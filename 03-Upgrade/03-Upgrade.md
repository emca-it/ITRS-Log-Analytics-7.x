   - ./install.sh -u

### Required post upgrade

- Recreate bundles/cache: ```rm -rf /usr/share/kibana/optimize/bundles/* && systemctl restart kibana```

### Required post upgrade from version 7.1.3

In this version, the name "wiki" has been replace by "e-doc".
Due to this change user have to check if there are differences in config.yml and database.sqlite files.
If the user made his own changes to one of these files before update after the update, the files with .rpmsave extension
will appear in the /opt/wiki folder.

1. In case there is config.yml.rpmsave file in /opt/wiki directory, follow the steps below:
   - Rename config.yml to config.yml.new: # mv /opt/e-doc/config.yml /opt/e-doc/config.yml.new
   - Move config.yml.rpmsave to e-doc directory: # mv /opt/wiki/config.yml.rpmsave /opt/e-doc/config.yml
   - Compare files config.yml/config.yml.new and apply changes from config.yml.new to config.yml:
      a. new default path to db storage: "/opt/e-doc/database.sqlite"
      b. new default kibanaCredentials: "e-doc:e-doc"
2. In case there is database.sqlite.rpmsave file in /opt/wiki directory, follow the steps below:
   - Stop kibana service: # systemctl stop kibana
   - Stop e-doc service: # systemctl stop e-doc
   - Replace database file: # mv /opt/wiki/database.sqlite.rpmsave /opt/e-doc/database.sqlite
   - Change permissions to the e-doc: # chown e-doc:e-doc /opt/e-doc/database.sqlite
   - Start e-doc service: # systemctl start e-doc
   - Start kibana service: # systemctl start kibana

## Upgrade from version 7.1.0

### Preferred Upgrade steps

Run upgrade script:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh -u
   ```

### Required post upgrade

- (SIEM only) Update user in license-service to `license`,
- Update logtrail pipeline in Logstash configuration,
- Migrate logtrail-* indices to new format (the next call will display the current status of the task):

   ```bash
   for index in logtrail-kibana logtrail-alert logtrail-elasticsearch logtrail-logstash; do curl -XPOST "127.0.0.1:9200/_logserver/prepareindex/$index" -u logserver;done
   ```

## Upgrade from version 7.0.6

### **Breaking and major changes**

- During the update, the "kibana" role will be removed and replaced by "gui-access", "gui-objects", "report". The three will automatically be assigned to all users that prior had the "kibana" role. If you had a custom role that allowed users to log in to the GUI this WILL STOP WORKING and you will have to manually enable the access for users.
- The above is also true for LDAP users. If role mapping has been set for role kibana this will have to be manually updated to "gui-access" and if required "gui-objects" and "report" roles.
- If any changes have been made to the "kibana" role paths, those will be moved to "gui-objects". GUI objects permissions also will be moved to "gui-objects" for "gui-access" cannot be used as a default role.
- The "gui-access" is a read-only role and cannot be modified. By default, it will allow users to access all GUI apps; to constrain user access, assign user a role with limited apps permissions.
- "small_backup.sh" script changed name to "configuration-backup.sh" - this might break existing cron jobs
- SIEM plan is now a separate add-on package (requires an additional license)
- Network-Probe is now a separate add-on package (requires an additional license)
- (SIEM) Verify rpmsave files for alert and restore them if needed for following:
  - /opt/alert/config.yaml
  - /opt/alert/op5_auth_file.yml
  - /opt/alert/smtp_auth_file.yml

### Preferred Upgrade steps

1. Run upgrade script:
   - ./install.sh -u

#### Required post upgrade

- Full restart of the cluster is necessary when upgrading from 7.0.6 or below.
- Role "wiki" has to be modified to contain only path: ".wiki" and all methods,
- Configure the License Service according to the *Configuration* section.

### Pre-upgrade steps for data node

1. Stop the Logstash service

   ```bash
   systemctl stop logstash
   ```

1. Flush sync for indices

   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST "localhost:9200/_flush/synced?pretty" -u$USER:$PASSWORD
   ```

1. Close all indexes with production data, except system indexes (the name starts with a dot `.`), example of query:

   ```bash
   for i in `curl -u$USER:$PASSWORD "localhost:9200/_cat/indices/winlogbeat*?h=i"` ; do curl -u$USER:$PASSWORD -X POST localhost:9200/$i/_close ; done
   ```

1. Disable shard allocation

   ```bash
   curl -u$USER:$PASSWORD -X PUT "localhost:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d' { "persistent": {"cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "none"}}'
   ```

1. Check Cluster Status

    ```bash
    export CREDENTIAL="logserver:logserver"
    
    curl -s -u $CREDENTIAL localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
    ```

1. Verification of Configuration Files

    Please, verify your Elasticsearch configuration and JVM configuration in files:

        - /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options – check JVM HEAP settings and another parameters

    ```bash
    grep Xm /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options <- old configuration file
    ## -Xms4g
    ## -Xmx4g
    # Xms represents the initial size of total heap space
    # Xmx represents the maximum size of total heap space
    -Xms600m
    -Xmx600m
    ```

    ```bash
    cp /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options.rpmnew /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options
    cp: overwrite ‘/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options’? y
    ```

    ```bash
    vim /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options
    ```

    - /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml – verify elasticsearch configuration file

    - compare exiting /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml and /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml.rpmnew

1. Start and enable Elasticsearch service
    If everything went correctly, we will restart the Elasticsearch instance:

    ```bash
    systemctl restart elasticsearch
    systemctl reenable elasticsearch
    ```

    ```bash
    systemctl status elasticsearch

    ```

1. Check cluster/indices status and Elasticsearch version

    Invoke curl command to check the status of Elasticsearch:

    ```bash
    curl -s -u $CREDENTIAL localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty
    {
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
      "status" : "green",
      "timed_out" : false,
      "number_of_nodes" : 1,
      "number_of_data_nodes" : 1,
      "active_primary_shards" : 25,
      "active_shards" : 25,
      "relocating_shards" : 0,
      "initializing_shards" : 0,
      "unassigned_shards" : 0,
      "delayed_unassigned_shards" : 0,
      "number_of_pending_tasks" : 0,
      "number_of_in_flight_fetch" : 0,
      "task_max_waiting_in_queue_millis" : 0,
      "active_shards_percent_as_number" : 100.0
    }
    ```

    ```bash
    curl -s -u $CREDENTIAL localhost:9200
    {
      "name" : "node-1",
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
      "cluster_uuid" : "igrASEDRRamyQgy-zJRSfg",
      "version" : {
        "number" : "7.3.2",
        "build_flavor" : "oss",
        "build_type" : "rpm",
        "build_hash" : "1c1faf1",
        "build_date" : "2019-09-06T14:40:30.409026Z",
        "build_snapshot" : false,
        "lucene_version" : "8.1.0",
        "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
        "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
      },
      "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
    }
    ```

1. Install new version of default base template

```bash
curl -k -XPUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u logserver:logserver 'http://127.0.0.1:9200/_template/default-base-template-0' -d@/usr/share/elasticsearch/default-base-template-0.json
```

If everything went correctly, we should see 100% allocated shards in cluster health. However, while connection on port 9200/TCP we  can observe a new version of Elasticsearch.

### Post-upgrade steps for data node

1. Start Elasticsearch service

   ```bash
   systemctl statrt elasticsearch
   ```

1. Delete .auth index

   ```bash
   curl -u$USER:$PASSWORD -X DELETE localhost:9200/.auth
   ```

1. Use `elasticdump` to get all templates and load it back

   - get templates

   ```bash
   /usr/share/kibana/elasticdump/elasticdump  --output=http://logserver:logserver@localhost:9200 --input=templates_elasticdump.json --type=template
   ```

   - delete templates

   ```bash
   for i in `curl -ss -ulogserver:logserver http://localhost:9200/_cat/templates | awk '{print $1}'`; do curl -ulogserver:logserver -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/_template/$i ; done
   ```

   - load templates

   ```bash
   /usr/share/kibana/elasticdump/elasticdump  --input=http://logserver:logserver@localhost:9200 --output=templates_elasticdump.json --type=template
   ```

1. Open indexes that were closed before the upgrade, example of query:

   ```bash
   curl -ss -u$USER:$PASSWORD "http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices/winlogbeat*?h=i,s&s=i" |awk '{if ($2 ~ /close/) system("curl -ss -u$USER:$PASSWORD -XPOST http://localhost:9200/"$1"/_open?pretty")}'
   ```

1. Start the Logstash service

   ```bash
   systemctl start logstash
   ```

1. Enable Elasticsearch allocation

   ```bash
   curl -sS -u$USER:$PASSWORD -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d' { "persistent": {"cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "none"}}'
   ```

1. After starting on GUI remove aliases .kibana* (double version of index patterns)

   ```bash
   curl -u$USER:$PASSWORD "http://localhost:9200/.kibana_1/_alias/_all" -XDELETE
   ```

### Upgrade ITRS Log Analytics Client Node

1. Upload packages

    - Upload new rpm by scp/ftp:

    ```bash
    scp ./itrs-log-analytics-client-node-7.0.1-1.el7.x86_64.rpm root@hostname:~/
    ```

    - Backup report logo file.

1. Uninstall old version ITRS Log Analytics GUI

    - Remove old package:

    ```bash
    systemctl stop kibana alert
    ```

    ```bash
    yum remove itrs-log-analytics-client-node

```

## Changing OpenJDK version

### Logstash

OpenJDK 11 is supported by Logstash from version 6.8 so if you have an older version of Logstash you must update it.

To update Logstash, follow the steps below:

1. Back up the following files
    - /etc/logstash/logstash.yml
    - /etc/logstash/pipelines.yml
    - /etc/logstash/conf.d

2. Use the command to check custom Logstash plugins:

    ```bash
    /usr/share/bin/logstash-plugin list --verbose
    ```

    and note the result

3. Install a newer version of Logstash according to the instructions:

    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/6.8/upgrading-logstash.html

    or

    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/upgrading-logstash.html

4. Verify installed plugins:

    ```bash
    /usr/share/bin/logstash-plugin list --verbose
    ```

5. Install the missing plugins if necessary:

    ```bash
    /usr/share/bin/logstash-plugin install plugin_name
    ```

6. Run Logstash using the command:

    ```bash
    systemctl start logstash
    ```

### Elasticsearch

ITRS Log Analytics can use OpenJDK version 10 or later.
If you want to use OpenJSK version 10 or later, configure the Elasticsearch service as follows:

1. After installing OpenJDK, select the correct version that Elasticsearch will use:

    ```bash
    alternative --config java
    ```

2. Open the `/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options` file in a text editor:

    ```bash
    vi /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options
    ```

3. Disable the OpenJDK version 8 section:

    ```bash
    ## JDK 8 GC logging

    #8:-XX:+PrintGCDetails
    #8:-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps
    #8:-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution
    #8:-XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime
    #8:-Xloggc:/var/log/elasticsearch/gc.log
    #8:-XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation
    #8:-XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=32
    #8:-XX:GCLogFileSize=64m
    ```

4. Enable the OpenJDK version 11 section

    ```bash
    ## G1GC Configuration
    # NOTE: G1GC is only supported on JDK version 10 or later.
    # To use G1GC uncomment the lines below.
    10-:-XX:-UseConcMarkSweepGC
    10-:-XX:-UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly
    10-:-XX:+UseG1GC
    10-:-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=75
    ```

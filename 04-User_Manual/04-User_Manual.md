# User Manual

## Introduction

ITRS Log Analytics is an innovation solution allowing for centralized IT
systems events. It allows for an immediate review, analysis, and
reporting of system logs - the amount of data does not matter.
ITRS Log Analytics is a response to the huge demand for the storage and analysis of large amounts of data from IT systems.ITRS Log Analytics is an innovation solution that responds to the need to effectively process large amounts of data coming from the IT
environments of today's organizations. Based on the open-source
project Elasticsearch valued on the market, we have created an
efficient solution with powerful data storage and searching
capabilities. The System has been enriched with functionality that
ensures the security of stored information, verification of users,
data correlation and visualization, alerting, and reporting.

![](/media/media/image2_js.png)

ITRS Log Analytics project was created to centralize events of all IT
areas in the organization. We focused on creating a tool that
functionality is most expected by IT departments. Because an effective
licensing model has been applied, the solution can be implemented in
the scope expected by the customer even with a very large volume of
data. At the same time, the innovation architecture allows for
servicing a large portion of data, which cannot be dedicated to solutions with limited scalability.

### Elasticsearch ##

Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database solution that is the heart of our
system. Text information sent to the system, application, and system
logs are processed by Logstash filters and directed to Elasticsearch.
This storage environment creates, based on the received data, their
respective layout in a binary form, called a data index. The Index is
kept on Elasticsearch nodes, implementing the appropriate assumptions
from the configuration, such as:

- Replication index between nodes,
- Distribution index between nodes.

The Elasticsearch environment consists of nodes:

- Data node - responsible for storing documents in indexes,
- Master node - responsible for the supervision of nodes,
- Client node - responsible for cooperation with the client.

Data, Master, and Client elements are found even in the smallest
Elasticsearch installations, therefore often the environment is
referred to as a cluster, regardless of the number of nodes
configured. Within the cluster, Elasticsearch decides which data
portions are held on a specific node.

Index layout, their name, and set of fields are arbitrary and depend on the form of system usage. It is common practice to put data of a
similar nature to the same type of index that has a permanent first
part of the name. The second part of the name often remains the date
the index was created, which in practice means that the new index is
created every day. This practice, however, is conventional and every
index can have its rotation convention, name convention, construction scheme, and its own set of other features. As a result of passing the document through the

The Indexes are built with elementary parts called shards. It is good
practice to create Indexes with the number of shards that is the
multiple of the Elasticsearch data nodes number. Elasticsearch in the 7.x version has a new feature called Sequence IDs that guarantees more successful and efficient shard recovery. \

Elasticsearch uses *mapping* to describe the fields or properties that documents of that type may have. Elasticsearch in the 7.x version restricts indices to a single type.

### Kibana

Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack. Kibana gives you the freedom to select the way you give
shape to your data. And you don’t always have to know what you're looking for. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line
graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. Plus, you can use Vega grammar to design your visualizations. All leverage the full
aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.  Perform advanced time series analysis on your Elasticsearch data with our curated time series
UIs. Describe queries, transformations, and visualizations with powerful, easy-to-learn expressions. Kibana 7.x has two new features - a new "Full-screen" mode for viewing dashboards, and a new "Dashboard-only" mode which enables administrators to share dashboards safely.

### Logstash

Logstash is an open-source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities. Logstash can dynamically unify data from
disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your choice. Cleanse and democratize all your data for diverse advanced
downstream analytics and visualization use cases.

While Logstash originally drove innovation in log collection, its capabilities extend well beyond that use case. Any type of event can be
enriched and transformed with a broad array of input, filter, and output plugins, with many native codecs further simplifying the
ingestion process. Logstash accelerates your insights by harnessing a greater volume and variety of data.

Logstash 7.x version supports native support for multiple pipelines. These pipelines are defined in a *pipelines.yml* file which is loaded by default.
Users will be able to manage multiple pipelines within Kibana. This solution uses Elasticsearch to store pipeline configurations and allows for on-the-fly reconfiguration of Logstash pipelines.

### ELK

"ELK" is the acronym for three open-source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics
engine. Logstash is a server‑side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it,
and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch. Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.
The Elastic Stack is the next evolution of the ELK Stack.

## Data source

Where does the data come from?

ITRS Log Analytics is a solution allowing effective data processing
from the IT environment that exists in the organization.

The Elsasticsearch engine allows the building database in which large amounts of data are stored in ordered indexes. The Logstash module is responsible for loading data into Indexes, whose function is to collect
data on specific TCP/UDP ports, filter them, normalize them, and place them in the appropriate index. Additional plugins, that we can use in
Logstash reinforce the work of the module and increase its efficiency,
enabling the module to quickly interpret data and parse it.

Below is an example of several of the many available Logstash plugins:

**exec** - receive an output of the shell function as an event;

**imap** - read email from IMAP servers;

**jdbc** - create events based on JDC data;

**jms** - create events from Jms broker;

Both Elasticsearch and Logstash are free Open-Source solutions.

More information about the Elasticsearch module can be found at:
[https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch)

List of available Logstash plugins:
[https://github.com/elastic/logstash-docs/tree/master/docs/plugins](https://github.com/elastic/logstash-docs/tree/master/docs/plugins)

## System services

- elasticsearch.service -
  we can run it with a command:

```bash
systemctl start elasticsearch.service
```

  we can check its status with a command:

  ```bash
systemctl status elasticsearch.service
  ```

![](/media/media/image86.PNG)

- kibana.service -
  we can run it with a command:

```bash  
systemctl start kibana.service
```

  we can check its status with a command:

```bash
systemctl status kibana.service
```

![](/media/media/image87.PNG)

- logstash.service -
   we can run it with a command:

```

![](/media/media/image88.PNG)

## First login

If you log in to ITRS Log Analytics for the first time, you must
specify the Index to be searched. We have the option of entering the
name of your index, indicating a specific index from a given day, or using the asterisk () to indicate all of them matching a specific
index pattern. Therefore, to start working with the ITRS Log Analytics application, we log in to it (by default the user:
logserver/password:logserver).

![](/media_base/image3.png)

After logging in to the application click the button "Set up index pattern" to add a new index pattern in Kibana:

![](/media/media/image3_js.png)

In the "Index pattern" field enter the name of the index or index pattern (after
confirming that the index or sets of indexes exist) and click the "Next step" button.

![](/media/media/image4.png)

In the next step, from a drop-down menu select the "Time filter field name", after which individual event (events) should be sorted. By default the *timestamp* is set, which is the time of occurrence of the event, but depending on the preferences. It may also be the time of the indexing or other selected
based on the fields indicated on the event.

![](/media/media/image4_js.png)

At any time, you can add more indexes or index patterns by going to the main tab selecting „Management" and next selecting „Index Patterns".

## Index selection

After logging into ITRS Log Analytics, you will be going to the „Discover" tab, where you can interactively explore your data. You have access to every document in every index that matches the selected index patterns.

If you want to change the selected index, drop-down menu with the name of the current object in the left panel. Clicking on the object from the expanded list of previously created index patterns will change the searched index.

![](/media/media/image6.png)

### Index rollover

Using the rollover function, you can make changes to removing documents from the *audit*, *.agents*, and *alert\** indexes.

You can configure the rollover by going to the *Config* module, then clicking the *Settings* tab, going to the *Index rollover settings* section, and clicking the *Configure* button:

![](/media/media/image167.png)

You can set the following retention parameters for the above indexes:

- Maximum size (GB);
- Maximum age (h);
- Maximum number of documents.

## Discovery

### Time settings and refresh

In the upper right corner, there is a section that defines the
range of time that ITRS Log Analytics will search in terms of conditions contained in
the search bar. The default value is the last 15 minutes.

![](/media/media/image7.png)

After clicking this selection, we can adjust the scope of the search by selecting one of the three tabs in the drop-down window:

- **Quick**: contains several predefined ranges that should be clicked.
- **Relative**: in this window specify the day from which ITRS Log Analytics should search for data.
- **Absolute**: using two calendars we define the time range for which the search results are to be returned.

![](/media/media/image8.png)

### Fields

ITRS Log Analytics in the body of searched events, recognize fields
that can be used to create more precision queries. The extracted
fields are visible in the left panel. They are divided into three types:
timestamp, marked on the clock icon; text, marked with the letter "t"![](/media/media/image10.png), and digital, marked with a hashtag![](/media/media/image11.png).

Pointing to them and clicking on an icon![](/media/media/image12.png), they are automatically transferred to the „Selected Fields" column and in the place of events, a table with selected columns is created regularly. In the "Selected Fields" selection you can also delete specific fields from the table by clicking![](/media/media/image13.png) on the selected element.

![](/media/media/image14_js.png)

### Filtering and syntax building

We use the query bar to search for interesting events. For example, after
entering the word „error", all events that contain the word will be
displayed, additional highlighting them with a yellow background.

![](/media/media/image15_js.png)

#### Syntax

Fields can be used similarly by defining conditions that interest us. The syntax of such queries is:

```lucene
fields_name:<fields_value>
```

Example:

```lucene
status:500
```

This query will display all events that contain the „status" fields
with a value of 500.

#### Filters

The field value does not have to be a single, specific value. For
digital fields we can specify a range in the following scheme:

```lucene
fields_name:[<range_from TO <range_to] 
```

Example:

```lucene
status:[500 TO 599]
```

This query will return events with status fields that are in the
range 500 to 599.

#### Operators

The search language used in ITRS Log Analytics allows to you use logical operators
„AND", „OR" and „NOT", which are key and necessary to build more
complex queries.

- **AND** is used to combine expressions, e.g. `error AND "access denied"`. If an event contains only one expression or the word `error` and `denied` but not the word access, then it will not be displayed.

- **OR** is used to search for the events that contain one OR other
   expression, e.g. `status:500 OR denied`. This query will display
   events that contain the word „denied" or a status field value of 500. ITRS Log Analytics uses this operator by default, so query `„status:500" "denied"` would return the same results.

- **NOT** is used to exclude the following expression e.g. „status:[500
   TO 599] NOT status:505" will display all events that have a status field, and the value of the field is between 500 and 599 but will
   eliminate from the result events whose status field value is exactly 505.

- **The above methods** can be combined by building even
   more complex queries. Understanding how they work and joining it, is
   the basis for effective searching and full use of ITRS Log Analytics.

   Example of query built from connected logical operations:

```lucene
status:[500 TO 599] AND („access denied" OR error) NOT status:505
```

Returns in the results all events for which the value of status fields
are in the range of 500 to 599, simultaneously contain the word
„access denied" or „error", omitting those events for which the status
field value is 505.

#### Wildcards

Wildcard searches can be run on individual terms, using `?` to replace a single character, and * to replace zero or more characters:

`qu?ck bro*`

Be aware that wildcard queries can use an enormous amount of memory and perform very badly — just think how many terms need to be queried to match the query string "a* b* c*".

#### Regular expressions

Regular expression patterns can be embedded in the query string by wrapping them in forward-slashes ("/"):

`name:/joh?n(ath[oa]n)/`

The supported regular expression syntax is explained in Regular expression syntax [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/regexp-syntax.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/regexp-syntax.html)

#### Fuzziness

You can run fuzzy queries using the ~ operator:

`quikc~ brwn~ foks~`

For these queries, the query string is normalized. If present, only certain filters from the analyzer are applied. For a list of applicable filters, see Normalizers.

The query uses the Damerau-Levenshtein distance to find all terms with a maximum of two changes, where a change is the insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character or transposition of two adjacent characters.

The default edit distance is 2, but an edit distance of 1 should be sufficient to catch 80% of all human misspellings. It can be specified as:

`quikc~1`

#### Proximity searches

While a phrase query (e.g. "john smith") expects all of the terms in the same order, a proximity query allows the specified words to be further apart or in a different order. In the same way that fuzzy queries can specify a maximum edit distance for characters in a word, a proximity search allows us to specify a maximum edit distance of words in a phrase:

`"fox quick"~5`

The closer the text in a field is to the original order specified in the query string, the more relevant that document is considered to be. When compared to the above example query, the phrase "quick fox" would be considered more relevant than "quick brown fox".

#### Ranges

Ranges can be specified for date, numeric, or string fields. Inclusive ranges are specified with square brackets [min TO max] and exclusive ranges with curly brackets {min TO max}.

 - All days in 2012:

    `date:[2012-01-01 TO 2012-12-31]`

 - Numbers 1..5

    `count:[1 TO 5]`

 - Tags between alpha and omega, excluding alpha and omega:

    `tag:{alpha TO omega}`

 - Numbers from 10 upwards

    `count:[10 TO *]`

 - Dates before 2012

   `date:{* TO 2012-01-01}`

Curly and square brackets can be combined:

 - Numbers from 1 up to but not including 5

    `count:[1 TO 5}`

 - Ranges with one side unbounded can use the following syntax:

```bash
    age:>10
    age:>=10
    age:<10
    age:<=10
```

### Saving and deleting queries

Saving queries enables you to reload and use them in the future.

#### Save query

To save the query, click on the "Save" button under the query bar:

![](/media/media/image16.png)

This will bring up a window in which we give the query a name and then
click the button![](/media/media/image17.png).

![](/media/media/image18_js.png)

Saved queries can be opened by going to „Open" from the main menu
at the top of the page, and selecting saved search from the search list:

![](/media/media/image19.png)

Additionally, you can use "Saved Searchers Filter.." to filter the search list.

#### Open query

To open a saved query from the search list, you can click on the name of the query
you are interested in.

After clicking on the icon![](/media/media/image21.png) on the name of the saved query and choosing "Edit Query DSL", we will gain access to the advanced editing mode, so that we can change the query at a lower level.

![](/media/media/image21.png)

It is a powerful tool designed for advanced users, designed to modify
the query and the way it is presented by ITRS Log Analytics.

#### Delete query

To delete a saved query, open it from the search list, and
then click on the button![](/media/media/image23.png) .

If you want to delete many saved queries simultaneously go to the "Management Object"
 -> "Saved Object" -> "Searches" select it in the list (the icon![](/media/media/image22.png) to the left of the query name), and then click the "Delete" button.

![](/media/media/image24_js.png)

From this level, you can also export saved queries in the same way. To
do this, you need to click on![](/media/media/image25.png) and choose the save location. The file will be saved in .json format. If you then want to import such a file to ITRS Log Analytics, click on a button![](/media/media/image26.png), at the top of the page and select the desired file.

### Manual incident

The `Discovery` module allows you to manually create incidents that are saved in the `Incidents` tab of the `Alerts` module. Manual incidents are based on search results or filtering.
For a manual incident, you can save the following parameters:

- Rule name
- Time
- Risk
- Message

![](/media/media/image141.png)

After saving the manual incident, you can go to the Incident tab in the Alert module to perform the incident handling procedure.

![](/media/media/image142.png)

### Change the default width of columns

To improve the readability of values in Discovery columns, you can set a minimum column width. The column width setting is in the CSS style files:

```bash
/usr/share/kibana/built_assets/css/plugins/kibana/index.dark.css
/usr/share/kibana/built_assets/css/plugins/kibana/index.light.css
```

To set the minimum width for the columns, e.g. 150px, add the following entry `min-width: 150px` in the CSS style files:

```css
.kbnDocTableCell__dataField {
   min-width: 150px;
   white-space: pre-wrap; }
```

## Visualizations

Visualize enables you to create visualizations of the data
in your ITRS Log Analytics indices. You can then build dashboards
that display related visualizations. Visualizations are based
on ITRS Log Analytics queries. By using a series of ITRS Log Analytics
aggregations to extract and process your data, you can create
charts that show you the trends, spikes, and dips.

### Creating visualization

#### Create

To create a visualization, go to the „Visualize" tab from the main menu.
A new page will appear where you can create or load
visualization.

#### Load

To load previously created and saved visualization, you
must select it from the list.

![](/media/media/image89.PNG)

To create a new visualization, you should choose the preferred method of data presentation.

![](/media/media/image89_js.PNG)

Next, specify whether the created visualization will be based on a new or
previously saved query. If on a new one, select the index whose
visualization should concern. If visualization is created from a saved
query, you just need to select the appropriate query from the list, or
(if there are many saved searches) search for them by name.

![](/media/media/image90.PNG)

### Visualization types

Before the data visualization will be created, first you have to
choose the presentation method from an existing list. Currently, there
are five groups of visualization types. Each of them serves different purposes.
If you want to see only the current number of products
sold, it is best to choose „Metric", which presents one value.

![](/media/media/image27_js.png)

However, if we would like to see user activity trends on pages at different hours and days, a better choice will be the „Area chart", which displays a chart with time division.

![](/media/media/image28_js.png)

The „Markdown widget" view is used to place text e.g. information
about the dashboard, explanations, and instructions on how to navigate.
Markdown language was used to format the text (the most popular use is
GitHub).
More information and instructions can be found at this link:
[https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/)

### Edit visualization and saving

#### Editing

Editing a saved visualization enables you to directly modify the object
definition. You can change the object title, add a description, and modify
the JSON that defines the object properties.
After selecting the index and the method of data presentation, you can enter
the editing mode. This will open a new window with an empty visualization.

![](/media/media/image29_js.png)

At the very top, there is a bar of queries that can be edited
throughout the creation of the visualization. It works in the same way
as in the "Discover" tab, which means searching the raw data, but
instead of the data being displayed, the visualization will be edited.
The following example will be based on the „Area chart". The
visualization modification panel on the left is divided into three tabs:
„Data", "Metric & Axes" and „Panel Settings".

In the „Data" tab, you can modify the elements responsible for which data
and how should be presented. In this tab, there are two sectors:
"metrics", in which we set what data should be displayed, and
„buckets" in which we specify how they should be presented.

Select the Metrics & Axes tab to change the way each metric is shown
on the chart. The data series are styled in the Metrics section, while the axes
are styled in the X and Y axis sections.

In the „Panel Settings" tab, there are settings relating mainly to visual
aesthetics. Each type of visualization has separate options.

To create the first graph in the char modification panel, in the „Data" tab we
add X-Axis in the "buckets" sections. In „Aggregation" choose „Histogram",
in „Field" should automatically be located "timestamp" and "interval":
"Auto" (if not, this is how we set it). Click on the
icon on the panel. Now our first graph should show up.

Some of the options for „Area Chart" are:

   **Smooth Lines** - is used to smooth the graph line.

![](/media/media/image30.png)

- **Current time marker** -- places a vertical line on the graph that
    determines the current time.

- **Set Y-Axis Extents** -- allows you to set minimum and maximum
    values for the Y axis, which increases the readability of the
    graphs. This is useful, if we know that the data will never be less than (the minimum value), or to indicate the goals of the company (maximum value).

- **Show Tooltip** -- option for displaying the information window
    under the mouse cursor, after pointing to the point on the graph.

   ![](/media/media/image31.png)

#### Saving

To save the visualization, click on the "Save" button under the query bar:
![](/media/media/image16.png)
give it a name and click the button![](/media/media/image17.png).

#### Load

To load the visualization, go to the "Management Object"
 -> "Saved Object" -> "Visualizations" and select it from the list. From this place,
we can also go into advanced editing mode. To view the visualization
use![](/media/media/image17_js.png) button.

## Dashboards

Dashboard is a collection of several visualizations or searches.
Depending on how it is built and what visualization it contains, it
can be designed for different teams e.g.:

- SOC - which is responsible for detecting failures or threats in
the company;
- business - which thanks to the listings can determine the popularity
of products and define the strategy of future sales and promotions;
- managers and directors - who may immediately have access to information
about the performance units or branches.

### Create

To create a dashboard from previously saved visualizations and queries,
go to the „Dashboard" tab in the main menu. When you open it, a
new page will appear.

![](/media/media/image32.png)

Clicking on the icon "Add" at the top of the page select the "Visualization" or "Saved Search"
tab.

![](/media/media/image32_js.png)

and selecting a saved query and/or visualization from the list will
add them to the dashboard. If, there are a large number of saved objects,
use the bar to search for them by name.

Elements of the dashboard can be enlarged arbitrarily (by clicking on
the right bottom corner of the object and dragging the border) and moving
(by clicking on the title bar of the object and moving it).

### Saving

You may change the time period of your dashboard.

At the upper right-hand corner, you may choose the time range of your dashboard.

![](/media/media/image147.png)

Click save and choose 'Store time with dashboard' if you are editing an existing dashboard. Otherwise, you may choose 'Save as a new dashboard' to create a new dashboard with the new time range.

To save a dashboard, click on the "Save" button at the up of the query bar
and give it a name.

### Load

To load the Dashboard, go to the "Management Object"
 -> "Saved Object" -> "Dashboard" and select it from the list. From this place,
we can also go into advanced editing mode. To view the visualization
use![](/media/media/image17_1_js.png) button.

### Sharing dashboards

The dashboard can be shared with other ITRS Log Analytics users as well
as on any page - by placing a snippet of code. Provided that it can
retrieve information from ITRS Log Analytics.

To do this, create a new dashboard or open the saved dashboard and click on "Share" at the top of the page. A window
will appear with the generated two URLs. The content of the first one "Embaded iframe"
is used to provide the dashboard in the page code, and the second "Link" is a link
that can be passed on to another user. There are two options for each,
the first is to shorten the length of the link, and the second is to copy to the clipboard the content of the given bar.

![](/media/media/image37.png)

### Dashboard drill down

In the discovery tab search for a message of Your interest

![](/media/media/image125.png)

----------

Save Your search

Check Your „Shared link” and copy it

![](/media/media/image127.png)
![](/media/media/image128.png)

**! ATTENTION !** Do not copy `„?_g=()”` at the end.

----------

Select Alerting module

![](/media/media/image129.png)

----------

Once Alert is created use `ANY` frame to add the following directives:

```yaml
Use_kibana4_dashboard: paste Your „shared link” here
```

`use_kibana_dashboard:` - The name of a Kibana dashboard to link to. Instead of generating a dashboard from a template, Alert can use an existing dashboard. It will set the time range on the dashboard to around the match time, upload it as a temporary dashboard, add a filter to the query_key of the alert if applicable, and put the URL to the dashboard in the alert. (Optional, string, no default).

----------

```yaml
Kibana4_start_timedelta
```

`kibana4_start_timedelta:` Defaults to 10 minutes. This option allows you to specify the start time for the generated kibana4 dashboard. This value is added in front of the event. For example,

```yaml
kibana4_start_timedelta: minutes: 2
```

----------

```yaml
Kibana4_end_timedelta
```

`kibana4_end_timedelta:` Defaults to 10 minutes. This option allows you to specify the end time for the generated kibana4 dashboard. This value is added to the back of the event. For example,

```yaml
kibana4_end_timedelta: minutes: 2
```

----------
Sample:
![](/media/media/image130.png)

----------
Search for triggered alerts in the Discovery tab.

Use alert* search pattern.

![](/media/media/image131.png)

Refresh the alert that should contain url for the dashboard.
Once available, the kibana_dashboard field can be exposed to dashboards giving You a real drill-down feature.

## Reports

### CSV Report

To export data to CSV Report click the ***Reports*** icon, you immediately go
to the first tab - ***Export Data***

In this tab, we have the opportunity to specify the source from which
we want to export. It can be an index pattern. After selecting it,
we confirm the selection with the Submit button, and a report is
created at the moment. The symbol
![](/media/media/image40.png)can refresh the list of reports and see
what its status is.

![](/media/media/image41_js.png)

We can also create a report by pointing to a specific index from the
drop-down list of indexes.

![](/media/media/image42_js.png)

We can also check which fields are to be included in the report. The
selection is confirmed by the Submit button.

![](/media/media/image43_js.png)

When the process of generating the report (Status: Completed) is
finished, we can download it (Download button) or delete it (Delete
button). The downloaded report in the form of a \*.csv file can be
opened in the browser or saved to the disk.

![](/media/media/image44_js.png)

In this tab, the downloaded data has a format that we can import into
other systems for further analysis.

### PDF Report

In the Export Dashboard tab, we can create graphic reports in PDF files.
To create such a report, just from the drop-down list of previously
created and saved Dashboards, indicate the one we are interested in,
and then confirm the selection with the Submit button. A newly
created export with the Processing status will appear on the list
under Dashboard Name.

### Scheduler Report (Schedule Export Dashboard) ##

In the Report selection, we have the option of setting the Scheduler
which from the Dashboard template can generate a report at time intervals.
To do this, go to the Schedule Export Dashboard tab.

![](/media/media/image48_js.png)

Scheduler Report (Schedule Export Dashboard)

In this tab mark the saved Dashboard.

![](/media/media/image49_js.png)

*Note: The default time period of the dashboard is last 15 minutes.*

*Please refer to **Discovery > Time settings and refresh** to change the time period of your dashboard.*

In the Email Topic field, enter the Message title, in the Email field
enter the email address to which the report should be sent. From the drop-down list choose at what frequency you want the report to be generated and sent.
The action configured in this way is confirmed with the Submit button.

![](/media/media/image50_js.png)

The defined action goes to the list and will generate a report to the
e-mail address, with the cycle we set, until we cannot cancel it with
the Cancel button.

## User roles and object management

### Users, roles, and settings

ITRS Log Analytics allows to you manage users and permission for
indexes and methods used by them. To do this click the "Config" button from the main menu bar.

![](/media/media/image38_js.png)

A new window will appear with three main tabs: „User Management",
„Settings" and „License Info".

From the „User Management" level we have access to the following
possibilities: Creating a user in „Create User", displaying users in
„User List", creating new roles in „Create Role" and displaying
existing roles in „List Role".

### Creating a User (Create User)

#### Creating user

To create a new user click on the Config icon and you immediately
enter the administration panel, where the first tab is to create
a new user (**Create User**).

![](/media/media/image52_js.png)

In the wizard that opens, we enter a unique username (Username field), and password for the user (field Password) and assign a role (field Role). In this field, we have the option of assigning more than one role.
Until we select a role in the Roles field, the Default Role field
remains empty. When we mark several roles, these roles appear in
the Default Role field. In this field, we have the opportunity to
indicate which role for a new user will be the default role with
which the user will be associated in the first place when logging in.
The default role field has one more important task - it binds all
users with the field/role set in one group. When one of the users
of this group creates the Visualization or the Dashboard it will be available
to other users from this role(group). Creating the account is confirmed
with the Submit button.

### User's modification and deletion, (User List)

Once we have created users, we can display their list. We do it in the next tab (**User List**).

![](/media/media/image53_js.png)

In this view, we get a list of user accounts with assigned roles and we
have two buttons: Delete and Update. The first of these is the ability to delete a user account. Under the Update button is a drop-down menu in
which we can change the previous password to a new one (New password),
change the password (Re-enter New Password), change the previously
assigned roles (Roles), to other (we can take the role assigned
earlier and give a new one, extend user permissions with new roles).
The introduced changes are confirmed with the Submit button.

We can also see the current user settings and clicking the Update button
collapses the previously expanded menu.

### Create, modify, and delete a role (Create Role), (Role List)

In the Create Role tab, we can define a new role with permissions that
we assign to a pattern or several index patterns.

![](/media/media/image54_js.png)

For example, we use the syslog2\* index pattern. We give this name
in the Paths field. We can provide one or more index patterns, their
names should be separated by a comma. In the next Methods field, we
select one or many methods that will be assigned to the role. Available
methods:

- PUT - sends data to the server
- POST - sends a request to the server for a change
- DELETE - deletes the index/document
- GET - gets information about the index /document
- HEAD - is used to check if the index /document exists

In the role field, enter the unique name of the role. We confirm the addition of a new role with the Submit button. To see if a new role has been added,
go to the net Role List tab.

![](/media/media/image55_js.png)

As we can see, the new role has been added to the list. With the
Delete button we have the option of deleting it, while under the
Update button, we have a drop-down menu thanks to which we can add or
remove an index pattern and add or remove a method. When we want to
confirm the changes, we choose the Submit button. Pressing the Update
button again will close the menu.

Fresh installation of the application has sewn solid roles, which grant users special rights:

- admin - this role gives unlimited permissions to administer/manage
the application
- alert - a role for users who want to see the Alert module
- kibana - a role for users who want to see the application GUI
- Intelligence - a role for users who are to see the Intelligence moduleObject access permissions (Objects permissions)

In the User Manager tab, we can parameterize access to the newly
created role as well as existing roles. In this tab, we can indicate
to which object in the application the role has access.

Example:

In the Role List tab, we have a role called **sys2**, it refers
to all index patterns beginning with syslog\* and the methods get,
post, delete, put and head are assigned.

![](/media/media/image56_js.png)

When we go to the Object permission tab, we have the option to choose
the sys2 role in the drop-down list choose a role:

![](/media/media/image57_js.png)

After selecting, we can see that we already have access to the objects:
two index patterns syslog2\* and ITRS Log Analytics-\* and on a dashboard Windows Events.
There are also appropriate read or update permissions.

![](/media/media/image58_js.png)

From the list, we have the opportunity to choose another object that we
can add to the role. We have the ability to quickly find this object
in the search engine (Find) and narrow the object class in
the drop-down field "Select object type". The object type is associated with saved previous documents in the sections Dashboard, Index pattern,
Search, and Visualization.
By buttons, ![](/media/media/image59.png) we have the ability to add or remove or
object, and the Save button to save the selection.

     ```

### Module Access

You can restrict access to specific modules for a user role. For example: the user can only use the Discovery, Alert, and Cerebro modules, the other modules should be inaccessible to the user.

You can do this by editing the roles in the `Role List` and selecting the application from the `Apps` list. After saving, the user has access only to specific modules.

![](/media/media/image165.png)

### Manage API keys

The system allows you to manage, create, and delete API access keys from the level of the GUI management application.

Examples of implementation:

1. From the main menu select the "Dev Tools" button:

   ![](/media/media/image213.png)

2. List of active keys:

   ![](/media/media/image209.png)

3. Details of a single key:

   ![](/media/media/image210.png)

4. Create a new key:

   ![](/media/media/image211.png)

5. Deleting the key:

   ![](/media/media/image212.png)

### Separate data from one index to different user groups

We can Separate data from one index to different user groups using aliases. For example, in one index we have several tags:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42172770/209846991-ca27566d-1a57-4d45-b5ae-24ce24ed5c84.png)

To separate the data, you must first set up an alias on the appropriate tag.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42172770/209850716-104762f8-4cb6-45dc-b651-287eacbf92d8.png)

Then assume a pattern index on the above alias.
Finally, we can assign the appropriate role to the new index pattern.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42172770/209851010-2dc583de-889b-4baf-bdc9-21cbaba820eb.png)

## Settings

### General Settings

The Settings tab is used to set the audit on different activities or events
and consists of several fields:

![](/media/media/image60_js.png)

- **Time Out in minutes** field - this field defines the time after how
    many minutes the application will automatically log you off
- **Delete Application Tokens (in days)** - in this field, we specify
    after what time the data from the audit should be deleted
- **Delete Audit Data (in days)** field - in this field, we specify after
    what time the data from the audit should be deleted
- The next fields are checkboxes in which we specify what kind of events
  are to be logged (saved) in the audit index. The events that can be
  monitored are: logging (Login), logging out (Logout), creating a
  user (Create User), deleting a user (Delete User), updating user
  (Update User), creating a role (Create Role), deleting a role
  (Delete Role), update of the role (Update Role), start of export
  (Export Start), delete of export (Export Delete), queries (Queries),
  result of the query (Content), if attempt was made to perform a
  series of operation (Bulk)
- **Delete Exported CSVs (in days)** field - in this field, we specify
    after which time exported files with CSV extension have to be removed
- **Delete Exported PDFs (in days)** field - in this field, we specify
    after which time exported files with PDF extension have to be removed

Each field is assigned the "Submit" button thanks to which we can confirm the changes.

### License (License Info)

The License Information tab consists of several non-editable
information fields.

![](/media/media/image61_js.png)

These fields contain information:

- Company - who owns the license, in this case, Foo Bar.
- Data nodes in cluster - how many nodes we can put in one
  cluster - in this case, 10
- No of documents - empty field
- Indices - number of indexes, symbol\[\*\] means that we can
  create any number of indices
- Issued on - the date of issue
- Validity - validity, in this case for 120 months
- Version - shows which version of ITRS Log Analytics is currently installed

#### Renew license

To change the ITRS Log Analytics license files on a running system, do the following steps.

1. Copy the current license files to the backup folder:

   ```bash
   mv /usr/share/elasticsearch/es_* ~/backup/
   ```

2. Copy the new license files to the Elasticsearch installation directory:

   ```bash
   cp es_* /usr/share/elasticsearch/
   ```

3. Add necessary permission to the new license files:

   ```bash
   chown elasticsearch:elasticsearch /usr/share/elasticsearch/es_*
   ```

4. Reload the license using the License API:

   ```bash
   curl -u $USER:$PASSWORD -X POST http://localhost:9200/_license/reload
   ```

### Special accounts

At the first installation of the ITRS Log Analytics application, apart
from the administrative account (logserver), special applications are
created in the application: alert, intelligence, and scheduler.

![](/media/media/image62_js.png)

- **Alert Account** - this account is connected to the Alert Module
which is designed to track events written to the index for the
previously defined parameters. If these are met the information
action is started (more on the action in the Alert section)
- **Intelligence Account** - this account is related to the module
of artificial intelligence which is designed to track events and learn
the network based on previously defined rules artificial intelligence
based on one of the available algorithms (more on operation in the
Intelligence chapter)
- **Scheduler Account** - the scheduler module is associated with this
account, which corresponds to, among others for generating reports

## Backup/Restore

### Backing up

The backup bash script is located on the hosts with Elasticsearch in the location: ```/usr/share/elasticsearch/utils/configuration-backup.sh```.

The script is responsible for backing up the basic data in the Logserver system (these data are the system indexes found in Elasticsearch of those starting with a dot  '.'  in the name),  the configuration of the entire cluster, the set of templates used in the cluster and all the components.

These components include the Logstash configuration located in ```/etc/logstash``` and the Kibana configuration located in ```/etc/kibana```.

All data is stored in the ```/tmp``` folder and then packaged using the ```/usr/bin/tar``` utility to ```tar.gz``` format with the exact date and time of execution in the target location, then the files from ```/tmp``` are deleted.

crontab
It is recommended to configure ```crontab```.

- Before executing the following commands, you need to create a crontab file, set the path to backup, and direct them there.

In the below example, the task was configured on hosts with the Elasticsearch module on the root.

```bash
# crontab -l #Printing the Crontab file for the currently logged in user 
0 1 * * * /bin/bash /usr/share/elasticsearch/utils/configuration-backup.sh
```

- The client-node host saves the backup in the /archive/configuration-backup/ folder.
- Receiver-node hosts save the backup in the /root/backup/ folder.

### Restoration from backup

To restore the data, extract the contents of the created archive, e.g.

```bash
# tar -xzf /archive/configuration-backup/backup_name-000000-00000.tar.gz -C /tmp/restore
```

Then display the contents and select the files to restore (this will look similar to the following):

```bash
# ls -al /tmp/restore/00000-11111/
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root    11111 01-08 10:29 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root     2222 01-08 10:41 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3333333 01-08 10:28 .file1.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     4444 01-08 10:28 .file_number2.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     5555 01-08 10:29 .file3.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root      666 01-08 10:29 .file4.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     7777 01-08 10:29 .file5.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       87 01-08 10:29 .file6.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root        1 01-08 10:29  file6.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       11 01-08 10:29 .file7.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     1234 01-08 10:29  file8.tar.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     0000 01-08 10:29 .file9.json
```

To restore any of the system indexes, e.g. ```.security```, execute the commands:

```bash
# /usr/share/kibana/elasticdump/elasticdump  --output="http://logserver:password@127.0.0.1:9200/.kibana" --input="/root/restore/20210108-102848/.security.json" –type=data
# /usr/share/kibana/elasticdump/elasticdump  --output="http://logserver:password@127.0.0.1:9200/.kibana" --input="/root/restore/20210108-102848/.security_mapping.json" --type=mapping
```

To restore any of the configurations e.g. ```kibana/logstash/elastic/wazuh```, follow the steps below:

```bash
# systemctl stop kibana
# tar -xvf /tmp/restore/20210108-102848/kibana_conf.tar.gz -C / --overwrite
```

```bash
# systemctl start kibana
```

To restore any of the templates, perform the following steps for each template:

- Select from the ```templates.json``` file the template you are interested in, omitting its name
- Move it to a new ```json``` file, e.g. ```test.json```
- Load by specifying the name of the target template in the link

```bash
# curl -s -XPUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u logserver '127.0.0.1:9200/_template/test -d@/root/restore/20210108-102848/test.json
```

To restore the cluster settings, execute the following command:

```bash
# curl -s -XPUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u logserver '127.0.0.1:9200/_cluster/settings' -d@/root/restore/20210108-102848/cluster_settings.json
```

## Index management

**Note** \
**Before using the *Index Management* module is necessary to set an appropriate password for the *Log Server* user in the following file: ```/usr/share/kibana/curator/curator.yml```***

The Index Management module allows you to manage indexes and perform activities such as:

 - Closing indexes,
 - Delete indexes,
 - Performing a merge operation for index,
 - Shrink index shards,
 - Index rollover.

The *Index Management* module is accessible through the main menu tab.

The main module window allows you to create new *Create Task* tasks, view and manage created tasks, that is:

 - Update,
 - Custom update,
 - Delete,
 - Start now,
 - Disable / Enable.

![](/media/media/image227.png)

**Note** ***Use the `Help` button***

![](/media/media/image223.png)

### Shrink action

Shrinking an index is a good way to reduce the total shard count in your cluster.

Several conditions need to be met in order for index shrinking to take place:

 - The index must be marked as read-only
 - A (primary or replica) copy of every shard in the index must be relocated to the same node
 - The cluster must have health green
 - The target index must not exist
 - The number of primary shards in the target index must be a factor of the number of primary shards in the source index.
 - The source index must have more primary shards than the target index.
 - The index must not contain more than 2,147,483,519 documents in total across all shards that will be shrunk into a single shard on the target index as this is the maximum number of docs that can fit into a single shard.
 - The node handling the shrink process must have sufficient free disk space to accommodate a second copy of the existing index.

The task will try to meet these conditions. If it is unable to meet them all, it will not perform a shrink operation.

Settings required:

- Action Name

## Intelligence Module

A dedicated artificial intelligence module has been built in the
ITRS Log Analytics system that allows the prediction of parameter values
relevant to the maintenance of infrastructure and IT systems. Such
parameters include:

- use of disk resources,
- use of network resources,
- using the power of processors
- detection of known incorrect behavior of IT systems

To access the Intelligence module, click the tile icon
from the main menu bar and then go to the „Intelligence" icon (To go
back, click on the „Search" icon).

![](/media/media/image38_js4.png)

There are 4 screens available in the
module:![](/media/media/image64.png)

- **Create AI Rule** - the screen allows you to create artificial
     intelligence rules and run them in scheduler mode or immediately
- **AI Rules List** - the screen presents a list of created artificial
     intelligence rules with the option of editing, previewing, and
     deleting them
- **AI Learn** - the screen allows to define the conditions for teaching
     the MLP neural network
- **AI Learn Tasks** - a screen on which the initiated and completed
     learning processes of neural networks with the ability to preview
     learning results are presented.# Create AI Rule #

To create the AI Rule, click on the tile icon from the main menu bar,
go to the „Intelligence" icon, and select the "Create AI Rule" tab.
The screen allows to defining of the rules of artificial intelligence
based on one of the available algorithms (a detailed description of
the available algorithms is available in a separate document).

![](/media/media/image65_js.png)

Description of the controls available on the fixed part of the screen:

- **Algorithm** - the name of the algorithm that forms the basis of the
artificial intelligence rule
- **Choose search** - search defined in the ITRS Log Analytics system,
which is used to select a set of data on which the artificial
intelligence rule will operate
- **Run** - a button that allows running the defined AI rule or saving it
to the scheduler and run as planned

The rest of the screen will depend on the chosen artificial
intelligence algorithm.

### The fixed part of the screen

![](/media/media/image65.png)

Description of the controls available on the fixed part of the screen:

- Algorithm - the name of the algorithm that forms the basis of the artificial intelligence rule

- Choose search - search defined in the ITRS Log Analytics system, which is used to select a set of data on which the artificial intelligence rule will operate

- Run - a button that allows running the defined AI rule or saving it to the scheduler and run as planned

The rest of the screen will depend on the chosen artificial intelligence algorithm.

### Screen content for regressive algorithms

![](/media/media/image66_js.png)

Description of controls:

- **feature to analyze from search** - analyzed feature (dictated)
- **multiply by field** - enable multiplication of algorithms after
    unique values of the feature indicated here. Multiplication allows
    you to run the AI rule one for e.g. all servers. The value "none" in
    this field means no multiplication.
- **multiply by values** - if a trait is indicated in the „multiply by
    field", then unique values of this trait will appear in this field.
    Multiplications will be made for the selected values. If at least one of the values is not selected, the „Run" buttons will be inactive.\`

In other words, multiplication means performing an analysis for many values from the indicated field, for example: `sourece_node_host`- which we indicate in `Multiply by field (from search)`.

However, in `Multiply by values (from search)` we already indicate values of this field for which the analysis will be performed for example: host1, host2, host3, ...

- **time frame** - feature aggregation method (1 minute, 5 minutes, 15
    minutes, 30 minutes, hourly, weekly, monthly, 6 months, 12 months)
- **max probes** - sets, how many samples back will be taken into account for
    analysis. A single sample is an aggregated data according to the
    aggregation method.
- **value type** - which values to take into account when aggregating for
    a given time frame (e.g. maximum from the time frame, minimum, average)
- **max predictions** - how many estimates we make ahead (we take
    time frame)
- **data limit** - limits the amount of data downloaded from the source.
    It speeds up processing but reduces its quality
- **start date** - you can set a date earlier than the current date to verify how the selected algorithm would work on historical data
- **Scheduler** - a tag if the rule should be run according to the plan
    for the scheduler. If selected, additional fields will appear;

![](/media/media/image67.png)

- **Prediction cycle** - plan definition for the scheduler, i.e. the
    cycle in which the prediction rule is run (e.g. once a day, every
    hour, once a week). In the field, enter the command that complies
    with the cron standard. Enable -- whether to immediately launch
    the scheduler plan or save only the definition
- **Role** - only users with the roles selected here and the
    administrator will be able to run the defend AI rules The selected
    „time frame" also affects the prediction period. If we choose
    "time frame = monthly", we will be able to predict one month
    ahead from the moment of prediction (according to the "prediction
    cycle" value)

### Screen content for the Trend algorithm

![](/media/media/image68_js.png)

Description of controls:

- **feature to analyze from search** - analyzed feature (dictated)

    this field means no multiplication.
- **multiply by values** - if a trait is indicated in the „multiply by
    field", then unique values of this trait will appear in this field.
    Multiplications will be made for the selected values. If at least
    one of the values is not selected, the „Run" buttons will be inactive.\`

    with the cron standard. Enable -- whether to immediately launch
    the scheduler plan or save only the definition
- **Role** - only users with the roles selected here and the
    administrator will be able to run the defend AI rules The selected
    „time frame" also affects the prediction period. If we choose
    "time frame = monthly", we will be able to predict one month
    ahead from the moment of prediction (according to the "prediction
    cycle" value)
- **Threshold** - default values -1 (do not search). Specifies the
    algorithm what level of exceeding the value of the feature „feature
    to analyze from cheese" is to look for. The parameter is currently used
    only by the "Trend" algorithm.

### Screen content for the neural network (MLP) algorithm ##

![](/media/media/image69_js.png)

Descriptions of controls:

- **Name** - name of the learned neural network
- **Choose search** - search defined in ITRS Log Analytics, which is used
    to select a set of data on which the rule of artificial intelligence
    will work
- **Below**, on the left, a list of attributes and their weights based on
    teaching ANN will be defined during the teaching. The user for each
    attribute will be able to indicate the field from the above-mentioned search, which contains the values of the attribute and
    which will be analyzed in the algorithm. The presented list (for
    input and output attributes) will have a static and dynamic part.
    Static creation by presenting key with the highest weights. The key
    will be presented in the original form, i.e. perf\_data./ The second
    part is a DropDown type list that will serve as a key update
    according to the user's nameing. On the right side, the attribute
    will be examined in a given rule/pattern. Here also the user must
    indicate a specific field from the search. In both cases, the input
    and output are narrowed based on the search fields indicated in
    Choose search.
- **Data limit** - limits the amount of data downloaded from the source.
    It speeds up the processing but reduces its quality.
- **Scheduler** - a tag if the rule should be run according to the plan
    or the scheduler. If selected, additional fields will appear:

![](/media/media/image67.png)

- **Prediction cycle** - plan definition for the scheduler, i.e. the
     cycle in which the prediction rule is run (e.g. once a day, every
     hour, once a week). In the field, enter the command that complies
     with the *cron* standard
- **Enable** - whether to immediately launch the scheduler plan or save
     only the definition
- **Role** - only users with the roles selected here and the
     administrator will be able to run the defined AI rules

### AI Rules List ##

![](/media/media/image70.png)

Column description:

- **Status**:
    - ![](/media/media/image71.png)- the process is being processed (the PID of the process is in brackets)
    - ![](/media/media/image72.png) - a process completed correctly
    - ![](/media/media/image73.png) - the process ended with an error
- **Name** - the name of the rule
- **Search** - the search on which the rule was run
- **Method** - an algorithm used in the AI rule
- **Actions** - allowed actions:
    - **Show** - preview of the rule definition
    - **Enable/Disable** - rule activation /deactivation
    - **Delete** - deleting the rule
    - **Update** - update of the rule definition
    - **Preview** - a preview of the prediction results (the action is
        available after the processing has been completed correctly).

### AI Learn ##

![](/media/media/image74.png)

Description of controls:

- **Search** - a source of data for teaching the network
- **prefix name** - a prefix added to the id of the learned model that
  allows the user to recognize the model
- **Input cols** - list of fields that are analyzed / input features.
  Here, the column that will be selected in the output column should
  not be indicated. Only those columns that are related to processing
  should be selected. **
- **Output col** - result field, the recognition of which is learned by
  the network. **This field should exist in the learning and testing
  data, but in the production data is unnecessary and should not
  occur. This field cannot be on the list of selected fields in "input
  col".**
- **Output class category** - here you can enter a condition in SQL
  format to limit the number of output categories e.g. `if((outputCol)
  \< 10,(floor((outputCol))+1), Double(10))`. This condition limits the
  number of output categories to 10. **Such conditions are necessary
  for fields selected in "output col" that have continuous values.
  They must necessarily be divided into categories. In the Condition,
  use your outputCol name instead of the field name from the index
  that points to the value of the "output col" attribute.**
- **Time frame** - a method of aggregation of features to improve their
  quality (e.g. 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1
  daily).
- **Time frames output shift** - indicates how many time frame units are to
  move the output category. This allows teaching the network with
  current attributes but for categories for the future.
- **Value type** - which values to take into account when aggregating for
  a given time frame (e.g. maximum from the time frame, minimum, average)
- **Output class count**- the expected number of result classes. **If
  during learning the network identifies more classes than the user
  entered, the process will be interrupted with an error, therefore it
  is better to set up more classes than less, but you have to keep in
  mind that this number affects the learning time.**
- **Neurons in the first hidden layer (from, to)** - the number of neurons in
  the first hidden layer. Must have a value \> 0. Jump every 1.
- **Neurons in the second hidden layer (from, to)** - the number of neurons in the second hidden layer. If = 0, then this layer is missing. Jump
  every 1.
- **Neurons in the third hidden layer (from, to)** - the number of neurons in the
  third hidden layer. If = 0 then this layer is missing. Jump every 1.
- **Max iter** (from, to) - maximum number of network teaching
  repetitions (the same data is used for learning many times in
  internal processes of the neural network). The slower it is. Jump
  every 100. The maximum value is 10, the default is 1.
- **Split data to train&test** - for example, the entered value of 0.8
  means that the input data for the network will be divided in the
  ratio 0.8 to learning, 0.2 for the tests of the network learned.
- **Data limit** - limits the amount of data downloaded from the source.
  It speeds up the processing but reduces its quality.
- **Max probes** - limits the number of samples taken to learn the
  network. Samples are already aggregated according to the selected
  "Time frame" parameter. It speeds up teaching but reduces its
  quality.
- **Build** - a button to start teaching the network. The button contains
  the number of required teaching curses. You should be careful and
  avoid one-time learning for more than 1000 courses. It is better to
  divide them into several smaller ones. One pass after a full data
  load takes about 1-3 minutes on a 4-core 2.4.GHz server.
  **The module has implemented the best practices related to the number
  of neurons in individual hidden layers. The values suggested by the
  system are optimal from the point of view of these practices, but the
  user can decide on these values himself.**

Under the parameters for learning the network, there is an area in
which teaching results will appear.

After pressing the "Refresh" button, the list of the resulting models
will be refreshed.

Autorefresh - selecting the field automatically refreshes the list of
learning results every 10s.

The following information will be available in the table on the left:

- **Internal name** - the model name given by the system, including the
    user-specified prefix

- **Overall efficiency** - the network adjustment indicator - allows to
    see at a glance whether it is worth dealing with the model. The
    greater the value, the better.

After clicking on the table row, detailed data collected during the
learning of the given model will be displayed. This data will be
visible in the box on the right.

The selected model can be saved under its name using the "Save
algorithm" button. This saved algorithm will be available in the
"Choose AI Rule" list when creating the rule (see Create AI Rule).

### AI Learn Tasks ##

The "AI Learn Task" tab shows the list of processes initiated teaching the ANN network
with the possibility of managing processes.

Each user can see only the process they run. The user in the role of
Intelligence sees all running processes.

![](/media/media/image75.png)

Description of controls:

- **Algorithm prefix** - this is the value set by the user on the AI
    Learn screen in the Prefix name field
- **Progress** - here is the number of algorithms generated / the number of all to be generated
- **Processing time** - duration of algorithm generation in seconds (or
     maybe minutes or hours)
- **Actions**:
    - **Cancel** - deletes the algorithm generation task (user requires
        confirmation of operation)
    - **Pause / Release** - pause/resume algorithm generation process.

AI Learn tab contains the Show in the preview mode of the ANN hyperparameters
After completing the learning activity or after the user has interrupted it,
the "Delete" button appears in the "Action" field. This button allows you to permanently
delete the learning results of a specific network.

### Scenarios of using algorithms implemented in the Intelligence module

#### Teaching MLP networks and choosing the algorithm to use:

1. Go to the AI Learn tab,
1. We introduce the network teaching parameters,
1. Enter your prefix for the names of the algorithms you have learned,
1. Press Build.
1. We observe the learned networks on the list (we can also stop the observation at any moment and go to other functions of the system. We will return to the learning results by going to the AI Learn Tasks tab and clicking the show action),
1. We choose the best model from our point of view and save it under our name,
1. From this moment the algorithm is visible in the Create AI Rule tab.

#### Starting the MLP network algorithm:

1. Go to the Create AI Rule tab and create rules,
1. Select the previously saved model of the learned network,
1. Specify parameters visible on the screen (specific to MLP),
1. Press the Run button.

#### Starting regression algorithm:

1. Go to the Create AI Rule tab and create rules,
1. We choose AI Rule, e.g. Simple Moving Average, Linear Regression, or Random Forest Regression, etc.,
1. Enter your rule name (specific to regression),
1. Set the parameters of the rule ( specific to regression),
1. Press the Run button.

#### Management of available rules:

1. Go to the AI Rules List tab,
1. A list of AI rules available for our role is displayed,
1. We can perform the actions available on the right for each rule.# Results of algorithms #

The results of the "AI algorithms" are saved to the index „intelligence" specially created
for this purpose. The index with the prediction result. The following fields are available in the index (where xxx is the name of
the attribute being analyzed):

- **xxx\_pre** - estimate value
- **xxx\_cur** - current value at the moment of estimation
- **method\_name** - the name of the algorithm used
- **rmse** - average square error for the analysis in which \_cur values
     were available. **The smaller the value, the better.**
- **rmse\_normalized** - mean square error for the analysis in which
     \_cur values were available, normalized with \_pre values. **The
     smaller the value, the better.**
- **overall\_efficiency** - efficiency of the model. **The greater the
     value, the better. A value less than 0 may indicate too little
     data to correctly calculate the indicator**
- **linear\_function\_a** - directional coefficient of the linear
     function y = ax + b. **Only for the Trend and Linear Regression
     Trend algorithm**
- **linear\_function\_b** - the intersection of the line with the Y axis
     for the linear function y = ax + b. **Only for the Trend and
     Linear Regression Trend algorithm.**

Visualization and signals related to the results of data analysis
should be created from this index. The index should be available to
users of the Intelligence module.

### Permission

Permission has been implemented in the following way:

- Only the user in the admin role can create/update rules.
- When creating rules, the roles that will be able to enable/disengage/view the rules will be indicated.

We assume that the Learn process works as an administrator.

We assume that the visibility of Search in AI Learn is preceded by
receiving the search permission in the module object permission.

The role of "Intelligence" launches the appropriate tabs.

An ordinary user only sees his models. The administrator sees all
models.

## Archive

The Archive module allows you to create compressed data files ([zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd)) from Elasticsearch indices. The archive checks the age of each document in the index and if it is older than defined in the job, it is copied to the archive file.

### Configuration

#### Enabling module

To configure the module edit the `kibana.yml` configuration file end set path to the archive directory - location where the archive files will be stored:

```bash
vim /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
```

remove the comment from the following line and set the correct path to the archive directory:

```vim
archive.archivefolderpath: '/var/lib/elastic_archive_test'
```

Archives will be saved inside above directory in the subdirectories that describes year and month of its creation. For example:

```bash
/var/lib/elastic_archive_test
├── 2022
│   └── 08
│       ├── enc3_2022-08-15.json.zstd
│       └── skimmer-2022.08_2022-08-06.json.zstd
└── 2023
    ├── 05
    │   ├── enc1_2023-05-25.json.zstd
    │   ├── enc2_2023-05-25.json.zstd
    │   └── skimmer-2023.05_2023-05-25.json.zstd
    └── 07
        └── skimmer-2023.07_2023-07-30.json.zstd
```

### Archive Task

#### Create Archive task

1. From the main navigation go to the "Archive" module.

2. On the "Archive" tab select "Create Task" and define the following parameters:

   - `Index pattern` - for the indices that will be archived, for example, `syslog*`
   - `Timestamp Field` - time field of the indices (default **@timestamp**)
   - `Older than (days)` - number of days after which documents will be archived
   - `Field names filter` - filter fields that should be archived
   - `Encrypt archives` - after enabling encryption, prompt with two password fields will be shown.

   - `Schedule task` (crontab format) - the work schedule of the ordered task.

   ![](/media/media/04_archive_create-archive-task.png)

#### Task List

In the `Task List`, you can follow the current status of ordered tasks. You can modify the task scheduler or delete a single or many tasks at once.

![](/media/media/04_archive_archive-task-list.png)

If the archiving task finds an existing archive file that matches the data being archived, it will check the number of documents in the archive and the number of documents in the index. If there is a difference in the number of documents then new documents will be added to the archive file.

To show more details of the task, click on the details cell of the desired row.

### Archive Search

The Archive Search module can search archive files for the specific content and back results in the `Task List`

#### Create Search task

1. From the main navigation go to the `Archive` module.
2. On the `Search` tab select `Create Task` and define the following parameters:

   - `Select range of listed archives` - files that matches selected range will be displayed in the list (default **last 14 days**)
   - `Search text` - field for entering the text to be searched
   - `File name` - list of archive files that will be searched
   - `Enable searching in encrypted archives` - enable option to search in encrypted archives

![](/media/media/04_archive_create-search-task.png)

The table footer shows the total number of found files for the specified date range

#### Task list

The searching process can take a long time. On the `Task List`, you can follow the status of the searching process. Also, you can view results and delete tasks.

![](/media/media/04_archive_search-task-list.png)

### Archive Restore

The Archive Restore module moves data from the archive to the Elasticsearch index and make it online.

#### Create Restore task

1. From the main navigation go to the `Archive` module.

2. On the `Restore` tab select `Create Task` and define the following parameters:

  - `Select range of listed archives` - files that matches selected range will be displayed in the list (default **last 14 days**)
  - `Destination index` - If a destination index does not exist it will be created. If exists data will be appended
  - `File name` - list of archive files that will be recovered to Elasticsearch index
  - `Enable restoring from encrypted archives` - enable option to restore data from encrypted archives

![](/media/media/04_archive_create-restore-task.png)

The table footer shows the total number of found files for the specified date range.

#### Task List

The process will index data back into Elasticsearch. Depend on archive size the process can take long time. On the `Task List` you can follow the status of the recovery process. Also you can view result and delete tasks.

![](/media/media/04_archive_restore-task-list.png)

### Search/Restore task with archives without metadata

When creating Search or Restore tasks, during selection of archives to use, some warnings could be seen. Following screenshot presents list of archives with enabled filter that shows only archives with warnings:

- `missing metadata`
- `missing archive file`

![](/media/media/04_archive_archives-list.png)

When particular archive's metadata could not be found following icon will be displayed:
![](/media/media/04_archive_missing-metadata-icon.png)

That archive can be used for task creation, but there are some issues to keep in mind:

  - encryption status of the archive without metadata cannot be established (can be either encrypted or not)
  - when task has enabled encryption handling (e.g. `Enable restoring from encrypted archives` or  `Enable searching in encrypted archives`), archives will be decrypted with provided password. If archive was not decrypted, an error is expected
  - when archive is potentially encrypted and password is not provided, an error is expected.

On the other hand, when metadata is present, but archive itself could not be located, following icon will be displayed: ![](/media/media/04_archive_missing-archive-icon.png)

That archive cannot be used for task creation and so cannot be selected.

### Identifying progress of archivisation/restoration process

The `/usr/share/kibana/data/archive/tasks` directory contains metadata files, that indicates the current status of the task. That files contains informations about all indices, that:

  - are about to be processed (**"Waiting"** status)
  - are processing (**"Running"** status)
  - were processed (**"Complete"** status)

If everything went according to the plan and the process has successfully finished, that metadata file will be removed. However, when some index cannot be processed or something unexpected happened, there will be **"Error"** status, with detailed message in the "error" field and metadata will remain in the system.

The above described situation is reflected in the GUI by the **Status** column in the Task List tables.

Moreover, in the metadata files can be found current process id (`pid`), total documents count and encryption details.

#### Uncompleted Tasks removal

1. List archive folder and find filename generated by uncompleted task.

    ```bash
    ls -la /archivefolderpath/
    -rw-r--r--. 1 kibana kibana          13 Mar 21 10:07 prd-srv-win-ad-2022.12.
    21_2022-12-21.json.zstd  
    ```

1. Find document in `.archive` index using filename from previous step

    `curl -s -k -X GET -ulogserver:... http://127.0.0.1:9200/.archive/_search?size=10000 |jq '.'| grep -B4 "prd-srv-win-ad-2022.12.21"`

1. Write down it's ID

    ```json
    "_id": "Q8teA4cBj_ghAWXFcMJA",
          "_score": 1.0,
          "_source": {
            "date": "2023-03-21T08:52:13.502Z",
            "filename": "prd-srv-win-ad-2022.12.21_2022-12-21.json.zstd", 
    ```

1. Remove documen using saved ID

    ```bash
    curl -s -k -X DELETE -ulogserver:... http://127.0.0.1:9200/.archive/_doc/Q8teA4cBj_ghAWXFcMJA
    ```

### Command Line tools

Archive files can be handled by the following commands `zstd`, `zstdcat`, `zstdgrep`, `zstdless`, `zstdmt`.

#### zstd

The command for decompress `*.zstd` the Archive files, for example:

```bash
zstd -d winlogbeat-2020.10_2020-10-23.json.zstd -o
 winlogbeat-2020.10_2020-10-23.json
```

#### zstdcat

The command for concatenate  `*.zstd` Archive files and print content on the standard output, for example:

```bash
zstdcat winlogbeat-2020.10_2020-10-23.json.zstd
```

#### zstdgrep

The command for print lines matching a pattern from `*.zstd` Archive files, for example:

```bash
zstdgrep "optima" winlogbeat-2020.10_2020-10-23.json.zstd
```

Above example is searching documents contain the "optima" phrase in winlogbeat-2020.10_2020-10-23.json.zstd archive file.

#### zstdless

  ![](/media/media/image192.png)

- After the site is successfully created, the browser will open the newly created site.

#### Create a "tree" of documents

***E-doc*** does not offer a document tree structure directly. Creating a structure (tree) of documents is done automatically by grouping sites according to the paths in which they are available.

1. To create document structures (trees), create sites with the following paths:

   ```markdown
   /en/linux/1-introduction
   /en/linux/2-installation
   /en/linux/3-configuration
   /en/linux/4-administration
   /en/linux/5-summary
   ```

2. The items in the menu are sorted alphabetically, so the site titles should begin with a number followed by a dot followed by the name of the site, for example:

   - for the site in the path ***/en/linux/1-introduction*** you should set the title ***1.Introduction***;
   - for the site in the path ***/en/linux/2-installation*** you should set the title ***2.Installation***;
   - for the site in the path ***/en/linux/3-configuration*** you should set the title ***3.Configuration***;
   - for the site in the path ***/en/linux/4-administration*** you should set the title ***4.Administration***;
   - for the site in the path ***/en/linux/5-summary*** you should set the title ***5.Summary***

3. In this way, you can create a structure (tree) of documents relating to one topic:

   ![](/media/media/image193.png)

4. You can create a document with chapters in a similar way. To do this, create sites with the following paths:

   ```e-doc
   /en/elaboration/1-introduction
   /en/elaboration/2-chapter-1
   /en/elaboration/2-chapter-1
   /en/elaboration/2-chapter-1
   /en/elaboration/3-summary
   ```

5. The menu items are in alphabetical order. Site titles should begin with a number followed by a period followed by a name that identifies the site's content:

   - for the site in the path ***/en/elaboration/1-introduction*** you should set the title ***1. Introduction***
   - for the site in the path ***/en/elaboration/2-chapter-1*** you should set the title ***2. Chapter 1***
   - for the site in the path ***/en/elaboration/2-chapter-2*** you should set the title ***2. Chapter 2***
   - for the site in the path ***/en/elaboration/2-chapter-3*** the title should be set to ***2. Chapter 3***
   - for the site in the path ***/en/elaboration/3-summary*** you should set the title ***3. Summary***

6. In this way, you can create a structure (tree) of documents related to one document:

   ![](/media/media/image194.png)

#### Embed allow iframes

                    (intervalCap will reset to the default whether the request is completed or not)
                    or will be carried over into the next interval count,
                    which will effectively reduce the number of new requests created in the next interval

                    If using Search Template then searchBody has to consist of "id" field and "params" objects
                    If "size" field is defined within Search Template, it will be overridden by --size parameter
                    See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-template.html for

--maxSockets
                    How many simultaneous HTTP requests can we process make?
                    (default:
                      5 [node <= v0.10.x] /
                      Infinity [node >= v0.11.x] )
--timeout
                    Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for
                    a request to respond before aborting the request. Passed
                    directly to the request library. Mostly used when you don't
                    care too much if you lose some data when importing
                    but rather have speed.
--offset
                    Integer containing the number of rows you wish to skip
                    ahead from the input transport.  When importing a large
                    index, things can go wrong, be it connectivity, crashes,
                    someone forgetting to `screen`, etc.  This allows you
                    to start the dump again from the last known line written
                    (as logged by the `offset` in the output).  Please be
                    advised that since no sorting is specified when the
                    dump is initially created, there's no real way to
                    guarantee that the skipped rows have already been
                    written/parsed.  This is more of an option for when
                    you want to get most data as possible in the index
                    without concern for losing some rows in the process,
                    similar to the `timeout` option.
                    (default: 0)
--noRefresh
                    Disable input index refresh.
                    Positive:
                      1. Much increase index speed
                      2. Much less hardware requirements
                    Negative:
                      1. Recently added data may not be indexed
                    Recommended to use with big data indexing,
                    where speed and system health in a higher priority
                    than recently added data.

### Elasticsearch's Scroll API

Elasticsearch provides a scroll API to fetch all documents of an index starting from (and keeping) a consistent snapshot in time, which we use under the hood. This method is safe to use for large exports since it will maintain the result set in cache for the given period of time.

NOTE: only works for --output

### Bypassing self-sign certificate errors

Set the environment NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 before running elasticdump

### An alternative method of passing environment variables before execution

NB : This only works with linux shells

NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 elasticdump --input="https://localhost:9200" --output myfile

## Curator - Elasticsearch index management tool

Curator is a tool that allows you to perform index management tasks, such as:

- Close Indices
- Delete Indices
- Delete Snapshots
- Forcemerge segments
- Changing Index Settings
- Open Indices
- Reindex data

And other.

### Curator installation

Curator is delivered with the client node installer.

### Curator configuration

Create directory for configuration:

```bash
mkdir /etc/curator
```

Create directory for Curator logs file:

```bash
mkdir /var/log/curator
```

### Running Curator

The curator executable is located in the directory:

```bash
/usr/share/kibana/curator/bin/curator
```

Curator requires two parameters:

- config - path to configuration file for Curator
- path to action file for Curator

Example running command:

```bash
/usr/share/kibana/curator/bin/curator --config /etc/curator/curator.conf /etc/curator/close_indices.yml
```

### Sample configuration file

----------

Remember, leave a key empty if there is no value.  None will be a string, not a Python "NoneType"

```bash
client:
  hosts:
    - 127.0.0.1
  port: 9200
#  url_prefix:
#  use_ssl: False
#  certificate:
  client_cert:
  client_key:
  ssl_no_validate: False
  http_auth: $user:$passowrd
  timeout: 30
  master_only: True

logging:
  loglevel: INFO
  logfile: /var/log/curator/curator.log
  logformat: default
  blacklist: ['elasticsearch', 'urllib3']
```

### Sample action file

- close indices

  ```yaml
  actions:
    1:
      action: close
      description: >-
        Close indices older than 30 days (based on index name), for logstash-
        prefixed indices.
      options:
        delete_aliases: False
        timeout_override:
        continue_if_exception: False
        disable_action: True
      filters:
      - filtertype: pattern
        kind: prefix
        value: logstash-
        exclude:
      - filtertype: age
        source: name
        direction: older
        timestring: '%Y.%m.%d'
        unit: days
        unit_count: 30
        exclude:
  ```

- delete indices

  ```yaml
  actions:
    1:
      action: delete_indices
      description: >-
        Delete indices older than 45 days (based on index name), for logstash-
        prefixed indices. Ignore the error if the filter does not result in an
        actionable list of indices (ignore_empty_list) and exit cleanly.
      options:
        ignore_empty_list: True
        timeout_override:
        continue_if_exception: False

## Cross-cluster Search

**Cross-cluster search** lets you run a single search request against one or more remote clusters. For example, you can use a cross-cluster search to filter and analyze log data stored on clusters in different data centers.

### Configuration

1. Use `_cluster` API to add least one remote cluster:

   ```bash
   curl -u user:password -X PUT "localhost:9200/_cluster/settings?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
   {
     "persistent": {
       "cluster": {
         "remote": {
           "cluster_one": {
             "seeds": [
               "192.168.0.1:9300"
             ]
           },
           "cluster_two": {
             "seeds": [
               "192.168.0.2:9300"
             ]
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }'
   ```

2. To search data in index `twitter` located on the `cluster_one` use following command:

   ```bash
   curl -u user:password -X GET "localhost:9200/cluster_one:twitter/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
   {
     "query": {
       "match": {
         "user": "kimchy"
       }
     }
   }'
   ```

3. To search data in index `twitter` located on multiple clusters, use following command:

   ```bash
   curl -u user:password -X GET "localhost:9200/twitter,cluster_one:twitter,cluster_two:twitter/_search?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
   {
     "query": {
       "match": {
         "user": "kimchy"
       }
     }
   }'
   ```

4. Configure index pattern in Kibana GUI to discover data from multiple clusters:

   ```bash
   cluster_one:logstash-*,cluster_two:logstash-*
   ```

   ![](/media/media/image133.png)

### Security

Cross-cluster search uses the Elasticsearch transport layer (default 9300/tcp port) to exchange data.  To secure the transmission, encryption must be enabled for the transport layer.

Configuration is in the `/etc/elasticsearch/elastisearch.yml` file:

```bash
# Transport layer encryption
logserverguard.ssl.transport.enabled: true
logserverguard.ssl.transport.pemcert_filepath: "/etc/elasticsearch/ssl/certificate.crt"
logserverguard.ssl.transport.pemkey_filepath: "/etc/elasticsearch/ssl/certificate.key"
logserverguard.ssl.transport.pemkey_password: ""
logserverguard.ssl.transport.pemtrustedcas_filepath: "/etc/elasticsearch/ssl/rootCA.crt"

logserverguard.ssl.transport.enforce_hostname_verification: false
logserverguard.ssl.transport.resolve_hostname: false

```

 Encryption must be enabled on each cluster.

## Sync/Copy

The Sync/Copy module allows you to synchronize or copy data between two Elasticsearch clusters.
You can copy or synchronize selected indexes or indicate index pattern.

### Configuration

Before starting Sync/Copy, complete the source and target cluster data in the `Profile` and `Create profile`tab:

- Protocol - http or https;
- Host - IP address ingest node;
- Port - communication port (default 9200);
- Username - username that has permission to get data and save data to the cluster;
- Password - password of the above user
- Cluster name

![](/media/media/image134.png)

You can view or delete the profile in the `Profile List` tab.

### Synchronize data

To perform data synchronization, follow the instructions:

- go to the `Sync` tab;
- select `Source Profile`
- select `Destination Profile`
- enter the index pattern name in `Index pattern to sync`
- or use switch `Toggle to select between Index pattern or name` and enter indices name.
- to create synchronization task, press `Submit` button

![](/media/media/image135.png)

### Copy data

To perform data copy, follow the instructions:

- go to the `Copy` tab;
- select `Source Profile`
- select `Destination Profile`
- enter the index pattern name in `Index pattern to sync`
- or use switch `Toggle to select between Index pattern or name` and enter indices name.
- to start copying data press the `Submit` button

![](/media/media/image136.png)

### Running Sync/Copy

Prepared Copy/Sync tasks can be run on demand or according to a set schedule.
To do this, go to the `Jobs` tab. With each task you will find the `Action` button that allows:

- running the task;
- scheduling task in Cron format;
- deleting task;
- download task logs.

## XLSX Import

The XLSX Import module allow to import your `xlsx` and `csv` file to indices.

### Importing steps

1. Go to XLSX Import module and select your file and sheet:

   ![](/media/media/image138.png)

2. After the data has been successfully loaded, you will see a preview of your data at the bottom of the window.

3. Press `Next` button.

4. In the next step, enter the index name in the `Index name` field, you can also change the pattern for the document ID and select the columns that the import will skip.

   ![](/media/media/image139.png)

5. Select the `Configure your own mapping` for every field. You can choose the type and apply more options with the advanced JSON.
   The list of parameters can be found here, https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/mapping-params.html

6. After the import configuration is complete, select the `Import` button to start the import process.

7. After the import process is completed, a summary will be displayed. Now you can create a new index pattern to view your data in the Discovery module.

## Logtrail

LogTrail module allow to view, analyze, search and tail log events from multiple indices in realtime. Main features of this module are:

- View, analyze and search log events from a centralized interface
- Clean & simple devops friendly interface
- Live tail
- Filter aggregated logs by hosts and program
- Quickly seek to logs based on time
- Supports highlighting of search matches
- Supports multiple Elasticsearch index patterns each with different  schemas
- Can be extended by adding additional fields to log event
- Color coding of messages based on field values

Default Logtrail configuration, keeps track of event logs for Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana and Alert processes.
The module allows you to track events from any index stored in Elasticsearch.

### Configuration

The LogTrail module uses the Logstash pipeline to retrieve data from any of the event log files and save its contents to the Elasticsearch index.

### Logstash configuration

Example for the file `/var/log/messages`

1. Add the Logstash configuration file in the correct pipline (default is "logtrail"):

    ```bash
    vi /etc/logstash/conf.d/logtrail/messages.conf
    ```

    ```bash
    input {
        file {
            path => "/var/log/messages"
            start_position => beginning
            tags => "logtrail_messages"
        }
    }
    filter {
            if "logtrail_messages" in [tags] {
                    grok {
                            match => {
                                    #"message" => "%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:syslog_timestamp} %{SYSLOGHOST:hostname} %{DATA:program}(?:\[%{POSINT:pid}\])?: %{GREEDYDATA:syslog_message}"
    # If syslog is format is "<%PRI%><%syslogfacility%>%TIMESTAMP% %HOSTNAME% %syslogtag%%msg:::sp-if-no-1st-sp%%msg:::drop-last-lf%\n"
                                    "message" => "<?%{NONNEGINT:priority}><%{NONNEGINT:facility}>%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:syslog_timestamp} %{SYSLOGHOST:hostname} %{DATA:program}(?:\[%{POSINT:pid}\])?: %{GREEDYDATA:syslog_message}"
                                    }
                            }
                    date {
                            match => [ "syslog_timestamp", "MMM  d HH:mm:ss", "MMM dd HH:mm:ss" ]
                    }
                    ruby {
                            code =>  "event.set('level',event.get('priority').to_i - ( event.get('facility').to_i * 8 ))"
                    }
            }
    }
    output {
        if "logtrail_messages" in [tags] {
            elasticsearch {
                hosts => "http://localhost:9200"
                index => "logtrail-messages-%{+YYYY.MM}"
                user => "logstash"
                password => "logstash"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. Restart the Logstash service

   ```bahs
   systemctl restart logstash
   ```

### Kibana configuration

1. Set up a new pattern index `logtrail-messages*`  in the ITRS Log Analytics configuration. The procedure is described in the chapter [First login](/02-00-00-Data_source_and_application_management/02-00-00-Data_source_and_application_management.md).

2. Add a new configuration section in the LogTrail configuration file:

   ```bash
   vi /usr/share/kibana/plugins/logtrail/logtrail.json
   ```

   ```bash
   {
     "index_patterns" : [
       {
         "es": {
           "default_index": "logstash-message-*",
           "allow_url_parameter": false
         },
         "tail_interval_in_seconds": 10,
         "es_index_time_offset_in_seconds": 0,
         "display_timezone": "Etc/UTC",
         "display_timestamp_format": "MMM DD HH:mm:ss",
         "max_buckets": 500,
         "default_time_range_in_days" : 0,
         "max_hosts": 100,
         "max_events_to_keep_in_viewer": 5000,
         "fields" : {
           "mapping" : {
               "timestamp" : "@timestamp",
               "display_timestamp" : "@timestamp",
               "hostname" : "hostname",
               "program": "program",
               "message": "syslog_message"
           },
           "message_format": "{{{syslog_message}}}"
         },
         "color_mapping" : {
           "field": "level",
           "mapping" : {
             "0": "#ff0000",
             "1": "#ff3232",
             "2": "#ff4c4c",
             "3": "#ff7f24",
             "4": "#ffb90f",
             "5": "#a2cd5a"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   
   ```

3. Restate the Kibana service

   ```bash
   systemctl restart kibana
   ```

### Using Logtrail

To access of the LogTrail module, click the tile icon from the main menu bar and then go to the „LogTrail” icon.

![](/media/media/image144.png)

The main module window contains the content of messages that are automatically updated.

![](/media/media/image145.png)

Below is the search and options bar.

![](/media/media/image146.png)

It allows you to search for event logs, define the systems from which events will be displayed, define the time range for events and define the index pattern.

## Logstash #

The ITRS Log Analytics use Logstash service to dynamically unify data
from disparate sources and normalize the data into destination of your
choose. A Logstash pipeline has two required elements, *input* and *output*,
and one optional element *filter*. The input plugins consume data from a source, the filter plugins modify the data as you specify, and the output plugins write the data to a destination.
The default location of the Logstash plugin files is: */etc/logstash/conf.d/*. This location contain following ITRS Log Analytics

ITRS Log Analytics default plugins:

- `01-input-beats.conf`
- `01-input-syslog.conf`
- `01-input-snmp.conf`
- `01-input-http.conf`
- `01-input-file.conf`
- `01-input-database.conf`
- `020-filter-beats-syslog.conf`
- `020-filter-network.conf`
- `099-filter-geoip.conf`
- `100-output-elasticsearch.conf`
- `naemon_beat.example`
- `perflogs.example`

### Logstash - Input "beats" ##

This plugin wait for receiving data from remote beats services. It use tcp
/5044 port for communication:

```bash
                input {
                        beats {
                                port => 5044
                        }
                }
```

### Getting data from share folder

Using beats, you can reading data from FTP, SFTP, SMB share.
Connection to remote resources should be done as follows:

#### Input - FTP server

- Installation

  ```bash
  yum install curlftpfs
  ```

- Create mount ftp directory

  ```bash
  mkdir /mnt/my_ftp
  ```

- Use `curlftpfs` to mount your remote ftp site. Suppose my access credentials are as follows:

  ```bash
  urlftpfs ftp-user:ftp-pass@my-ftp-location.local /mnt/my_ftp/
  ```

#### Input - SFTP server

- Install the required packages

  ```bash
  yum install sshfs
  ```

- Add user

  ```bash
  sudo adduser yourusername fuse
  ```

- Create local folder

  ```bash
  mkdir ~/Desktop/sftp
  ```

- Mount remote folder to local:

  ```bash
  sshfs HOSTuser@remote.host.or.ip:/host/dir/to/mount ~/Desktop/sftp
  ```

#### Input - SMB/CIFS server

- Create local folder

  ```bash
  mkdir ~/Desktop/smb
  ```

- Mount remote folder to local:

  ```bash
  mount -t smbfs //remoate.host.or.ip/freigabe /mnt -o username=testuser
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  mount -t cifs //remoate.host.or.ip/freigabe /mnt -o username=testuser
  ```

### Logstash - Input "network" ##

This plugin read events over a TCP or UDP socket assigns the appropriate tags:

```bash
input {
       tcp {
               port => 5514
               type => "network"
               tags => [ "LAN", "TCP" ]
       }
       udp {
               port => 5514
               type => "network"
               tags => [ "LAN", "UDP" ]
       }
}
```

To redirect the default syslog port (514/TCP/UDP) to the dedicated collector port, follow these steps:

```bash
firewall-cmd --add-forward-port=port=514:proto=udp:toport=5514:toaddr=127.0.0.1 --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-forward-port=port=514:proto=tcp:toport=5514:toaddr=127.0.0.1 --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
systemctl restart firewalld
```

### Logstash - Input SNMP

The SNMP input polls network devices using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to gather information related to the current state of the devices operation:

```bash
input {
  snmp {
    get => ["1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0"]
    hosts => [{host => "udp:127.0.0.1/161" community => "public" version => "2c"  retries => 2  timeout => 1000}]
  }
}
```

### Logstash - Input HTTP / HTTPS

Using this input you can receive single or multiline events over http(s). Applications can send an HTTP request to the endpoint started by this input and Logstash will convert it into an event for subsequent processing. Sample definition:

```bash
input {
  http {
    host => "0.0.0.0"
    port => "8080"
  }
}
```

Events are by default sent in plain text. You can enable encryption by setting ssl to true and configuring the ssl_certificate and ssl_key options:

```bash
input {
  http {
    host => "0.0.0.0"
    port => "8080"
    ssl => "true"
    ssl_certificate => "path_to_certificate_file"
    ssl_key => "path_to_key_file"
  }
}
```

### Logstash - Input Relp

#### Installation

For plugins not bundled by default, it is easy to install by running bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-input-relp.

#### Description

Read RELP events over a TCP socket.

This protocol implements application-level acknowledgments to help protect against message loss.

Message acks only function as far as messages being put into the queue for filters; anything lost after that point will not be retransmitted.

#### Relp input configuration options

This plugin supports the following configuration options plus the Common Options described later.

```ssl_enable``` - Enable SSL (must be set for other ssl_ options to take effect).

```ssl_key``` - SSL key path

```ssl_key_passphrase``` - SSL key passphrase

```ssl_verify``` - Verify the identity of the other end of the SSL connection against the CA. For input, sets the field sslsubject to that of the client certificate.

```add_field``` - Add a field to an event

```codec``` - The codec used for input data. Input codecs are a convenient method for decoding your data before it enters the input, without needing a separate filter in your Logstash pipeline.

```enable_metric``` - Disable or enable metric logging for this specific plugin instance by default we record all the metrics we can, but you can disable metrics collection for a specific plugin.

```id``` - Add a unique ID to the plugin configuration. If no ID is specified, Logstash will generate one. It is strongly recommended to set this ID in your configuration. This is particularly useful when you have two or more plugins of the same type, for example, if you have 2 relp inputs. Adding a named ID in this case will help in monitoring Logstash when using the monitoring APIs.

```bash
input {
  relp {
    id => "my_plugin_id"
  }
}
```

```tags``` - add any number of arbitrary tags to your event.

```type``` - Add a type field to all events handled by this input.

Types are used mainly for filter activation.

The type is stored as part of the event itself, so you can also use the type to search for it in Kibana.

If you try to set a type on an event that already has one (for example when you send an event from a shipper to an indexer) then a new input will not override the existing type. A type set at the shipper stays with that event for its life even when sent to another Logstash server.

### Logstash - Input Kafka

This input will read events from a Kafka topic.

Sample definition:

```bash
input {
  kafka {
    bootstrap_servers => "10.0.0.1:9092"
    consumer_threads => 3

    topics => ["example"]
    codec => json
    client_id => "hostname"
    group_id => "logstash"
    max_partition_fetch_bytes => "30000000"
    max_poll_records => "1000"

    fetch_max_bytes => "72428800"
    fetch_min_bytes => "1000000"

    fetch_max_wait_ms => "800"
    
    check_crcs => false

  }
}
```

```bootstrap_servers``` - A list of URLs of Kafka instances to use for establishing the initial connection to the cluster. This list should be in the form of host1:port1,host2:port2 These urls are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically) so this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).

```consumer_threads``` - Ideally you should have as many threads as the number of partitions for a perfect balance — more threads than partitions means that some threads will be idle

```topics``` - A list of topics to subscribe to, defaults to ["logstash"].

```codec``` - The codec used for input data. Input codecs are a convenient method for decoding your data before it enters the input, without needing a separate filter in your Logstash pipeline.

```client_id``` - The id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included.

```group_id``` - The identifier of the group this consumer belongs to. Consumer group is a single logical subscriber that happens to be made up of multiple processors. Messages in a topic will be distributed to all Logstash instances with the same group_id.

```max_partition_fetch_bytes``` - The maximum amount of data per-partition the server will return. The maximum total memory used for a request will be #partitions * max.partition.fetch.bytes. This size must be at least as large as the maximum message size the server allows or else it is possible for the producer to send messages larger than the consumer can fetch. If that happens, the consumer can get stuck trying to fetch a large message on a certain partition.

```max_poll_records``` - The maximum number of records returned in a single call to poll().

```fetch_max_bytes``` - The maximum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. This is not an absolute maximum, if the first message in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value, the message will still be returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress.

```fetch_min_bytes``` - The minimum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. If insufficient data is available the request will wait for that much data to accumulate before answering the request.

```fetch_max_wait_ms``` - The maximum amount of time the server will block before answering the fetch request if there isn’t sufficient data to immediately satisfy fetch_min_bytes. This should be less than or equal to the timeout used in poll_timeout_ms.

```check_crcs``` - Automatically check the CRC32 of the records consumed. This ensures no on-the-wire or on-disk corruption to the messages occurred. This check adds some overhead, so it may be disabled in cases seeking extreme performance.

### Logstash - Input File

This plugin stream events from files, normally by tailing them in a manner similar to tail -0F but optionally reading them from the beginning. Sample definition:

```bash
file {
    path => "/tmp/access_log"
    start_position => "beginning"
}
```

### Logstash - Input database

This plugin can read data in any database with a JDBC interface into Logstash. You can periodically schedule ingestion using a cron syntax (see schedule setting) or run the query one time to load data into Logstash. Each row in the resultset becomes a single event. Columns in the resultset are converted into fields in the event.

### Logstash - Input CEF

The common event format (CEF) is a standard for the interoperability of event or log generating devices and applications. The standard defines a syntax for log records. It comprises of a standard prefix and a variable extension that is formatted as key-value pairs.

```bash
input {
  tcp {
    codec => cef { delimiter => "\r\n" }
    port => 12345
  }
}
```

This setting allows the following character sequences to have special meaning:

- `\r` (backslash "r") - means carriage return (ASCII 0x0D)
- `\n` (backslash "n") - means newline (ASCII 0x0A)

### Logstash - Input OPSEC

FW1-LogGrabber is a Linux command-line tool to grab logfiles from remote Checkpoint devices. It makes extensive use of OPSEC Log Export APIs (LEA) from Checkpoint's [OPSEC SDK 6.0 for Linux 50](http://supportcontent.checkpoint.com/file_download?id=48148).

#### Build FW1-LogGrabber

FW1-LogGrabber v2.0 and above can be built on Linux x86/amd64 platforms only.

If you are interested in other platforms please check [FW1-LogGrabber v1.11.1 website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fw1-loggrabber/files/fw1-loggrabber/1.11.1/)

#### Download dependencies

FW1-LogGrabber uses API-functions from Checkpoint's [OPSEC SDK 6.0 for Linux 50](http://supportcontent.checkpoint.com/file_download?id=48148).

You must take care of downloading the Checkpoint OPSEC SDK and extracting it inside the `OPSEC_SDK` folder.

You also need to install some required 32-bit libraries.

If you are using **Debian or Ubuntu**, please run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib libelf-dev:i386 libpam0g:i386 zlib1g-dev:i386
```

If you are using **CentOS or RHEL**, please run:

```bash
sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ make glibc-devel.i686 elfutils-libelf-devel.i686 zlib-devel.i686 libstdc++-devel.i686 pam-devel.i686
```

#### Compile source code

Building should be as simple as running GNU Make in the project root folder:

```bash
make
```

If the build process complains, you might need to tweak some variables inside the `Makefile` (e.g. `CC`, `LD` and `OPSEC_PKG_DIR`) according to your environment.

#### Install FW1-LogGrabber

To install FW1-LogGrabber into its default location `/usr/local/fw1-loggrabber` (defined by `INSTALL_DIR` variable), please run

```bash
sudo make install
```

#### Set environment variables

FW1-LogGraber makes use of two environment variables, which should be defined in the shell configuration files.

- `LOGGRABBER_CONFIG_PATH` defines a directory containing configuration files (`fw1-loggrabber.conf`, `lea.conf`). If the variable is not defined, the program expects to find these files in the current directory.
- `LOGGRABBER_TEMP_PATH` defines a directory where FW1-LogGrabber will store temporary files. If the variable is not defined, the program stores these files in the current directory.

Since the binary is dynamically linked to Checkpoint OPSEC libraries, please also add `/usr/local/fw1-loggrabber/lib` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or to your dynamic linker configuration with

```bash
sudo echo /usr/local/fw1-loggrabber/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/fw1-loggrabber.conf
sudo ldconfig
```

#### Configuration files

#### lea.conf file

Starting with version 1.11, FW1-LogGrabber uses the default connection configuration procedure for OPSEC applications. This includes server, port and authentication settings. From now on, all this parameters can only be configured using the configuration file `lea.conf` (see `--leaconfigfile` option to use a different LEA configuration file) and not using the command-line as before.

- `lea_server ip <IP address>` specifies the IP address of the FW1 management station, to which FW1-LogGrabber should connect to.

- `lea_server port <port number>` is the port on the FW1 management station to which FW1-LogGrabber should connect to (for unauthenticated connections only).

- `lea_server auth_port <port number>` is the port to be used for authenticated connection to your FW1 management station.

- `lea_server auth_type <authentication mechanism>` you can use this parameter to specify the authentication mechanism to be used (default is `sslca`); valid values are `sslca`, `sslca_clear`, `sslca_comp`, `sslca_rc4`, `sslca_rc4_comp`, `asym_sslca`, `asym_sslca_comp`, `asym_sslca_rc4`, `asym_sslca_rc4_comp`, `ssl`, `ssl_opsec`, `ssl_clear`, `ssl_clear_opsec`, `fwn1` and `auth_opsec`.

- `opsec_sslca_file <p12-file>` specify the location of the PKCS#12 certificate, when using authenticated connections.

- `opsec_sic_name <LEA client SIC name>` is the SIC name of the LEA client for authenticated connections.

- `lea_server opsec_entity_sic_name <LEA server SIC name>` is the SIC name of your FW1 management station when using authenticated connections.

#### fw1-loggrabber.conf file

This paragraph deals with the options that can be set within the configuration file. The default configuration file is `fw1-loggrabber.conf` (see `--configfile` option to use a different configuration file). The precedence of given options is as follows: command line, configuration file, default value. E.g. if you set the resolve-mode to be used in the configuration file, this can be overwritten by command line option `--noresolve`; only if an option isn't set neither on command line nor in the configuration file, the default value will be used.

- `DEBUG_LEVEL=<0-3>` sets the debug level to the specified value; zero means no output of debug information, and further levels will cause output of program specific as well as OPSEC specific debug information.

- `FW1_LOGFILE=<name of log file>` specifies the name of the FW1 logfile to be read; this can be either done exactly or using only a part of the filename; if no exact match can be found in the list of logfiles returned by the FW-1 management station, all logfiles which contain the specified string are processed; if this parameter is omitted, the default logfile `fw.log` will be processed.

- `FW1_OUTPUT=<files|logs>` specifies whether FW1-LogGrabber should only display the available logfiles (`files`) on the FW11 server or display the content of these logfiles (`logs`).

- `FW1_TYPE=<ng|2000>` choose which version of FW1 to connect to; for Checkpoint FW-1 5.0 you have to specify `NG` and for Checkpoint FW-1 4.1 you have to specify `2000`.

- `FW1_MODE=<audit|normal>` specifies whether to display `audit` logs, which contain administrative actions, or `normal` security logs, which contain data about dropped and accepted connections.

- `MODE=<online|online-resume|offline>` when using online mode, FW1-LogGrabber starts retrieving logging data from the end of the specified logfile and displays all future log entries (mainly used for continuously processing); the online-resume mode is similar to the online mode, but if FW1-LogGrabber is stopped and started again, it resumes processing from where it was stopped; if you instead choose the offline mode, FW1-LogGrabber quits after having displayed the last log entry.

- `RESOLVE_MODE=<yes|no>` with this option (enabled by default), IP addresses will be resolved to names using FW1 name resolving behaviour; this resolving mechanism will not cause the machine running FW1-LogGrabber to initiate DNS requests, but the name resolution will be done directly on the FW1 machine; if you disable resolving mode, IP addresses will be displayed in log output instead of names.

- `RECORD_SEPARATOR=<char>` can be used to change the default record separator `|` (pipe) into another character; if you choose a character which is contained in some log data, the occurrence within the logdata will be escaped by a backslash.

- `LOGGING_CONFIGURATION=<screen|file|syslog>` can be used for redirecting logging output to other destinations than the default destination `STDOUT`; currently it is possible to redirect output to a file or to the syslog daemon.

- `OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX=<prefix of output file>` when using file output, this parameter defines a prefix for the output filename; default value is simply `fw1-loggrabber`.

- `OUTPUT_FILE_ROTATESIZE=<rotatesize in bytes>` when using file output, this parameter specifies the maximum size of the output files, before they will be rotated with suffix `-YYYY-MM-DD-hhmmss[-x].log`; default value is 1048576 bytes, which equals 1 MB; setting a zero value disables file rotation.

- `SYSLOG_FACILITY=<USER|LOCAL0|...|LOCAL7>` when using syslog output, this parameter sets the syslog facility to be used.

- `FW1_FILTER_RULE="<filterexpression1>[;<filterexpression2>]"` defines filters for `normal` log mode; you can find a more detailed description of filter rules, along with some examples, [in a separate chapter below](#filtering).

- `AUDIT_FILTER_RULE="<filterexpression1>[;<filterexpression2>]"` defines filters for `audit` log mode; you can find a more detailed description of filter rules, along with some examples, [in a separate chapter below](#filtering).

#### Command line options

In the following section, all available command line options are described in detail. Most of the options can also be configured using the file `fw1-loggrabber.conf` (see `--configfile` option to use a different configuration file). The precedence of given options is as follows: command line, configuration file, default value. E.g. if you set the resolve-mode to be used in the configuration file, this can be overwritten by command line option `--noresolve`; only if an option isn't set neither on command line nor in the configuration file, the default value will be used.

#### Help

Use `--help` to display basic help and usage information.

#### Debug level

The `--debuglevel` option sets the debug level to the specified value. A zero debug level means no output of debug information, while further levels will cause output of program specific as well as OPSEC specific debug
information.

#### Location of configuration files

The `-c <configfilename>` or `--configfile <configfilename>` options allow to specify a non-default configuration file, in which most of the command line options can be configured, as well as other options which are not available as command line parameters.

If this parameter is omitted, the file `fw1-loggrabber.conf` inside `$LOGGRABBER_CONFIG_PATH` will be used. [See above](#fw1-loggrabberconf-file) for a description of all available configuration file options.

Using `-l <leaconfigfilename>` or `--leaconfigfile <leaconfigfilename>` instead, it's possible to use a non-default LEA configuration file. In this file, all connection parameters such as FW1 server, port, authentication method as well as SIC names have to be configured, as usual procedure for OPSEC applications.

If this parameter is omitted, the file `lea.conf` inside `$LOGGRABBER_CONFIG_PATH` will be used. [See above](#leaconf-file) for a description of all available LEA configuration file options.

#### Remote log files

With `-f <logfilename|pattern|ALL>` or `--logfile <logfilename|pattern|ALL>` you can specify the name of the remote FW1 logfile to be read.

This can be either done exactly or using only a part of the filename. If no exact match can be found in the list of logfiles returned by the FW1 management station, all logfiles which contain the specified string are processed.

A special case is the usage of `ALL` instead of a logfile name or pattern. In that case all logfiles that are available on the management station, will be processed. If this parameter is omitted, only the default logfile `fw.log` will be processed.

The first example displays the logfile `2003-03-27_213652.log`, while the second one processes all logfiles which contain `2003-03` in their filename.

```bash
--logfile 2003-03-27_213652.log
--logfile 2003-03
```

The default behaviour of FW1-LogGrabber is to display the content of the logfiles and not just their names. This can be explicitely specified using the `--showlogs` option.

The option `--showfiles` can be used instead to simply show the available logfiles on the FW1 management station. After the names of the logfiles have been displayed, FW1-LogGrabber quits.

#### Name resolving behaviour

Using the `--resolve` option, IP addresses will be resolved to names using FW1 name resolving behaviour. This resolving mechanism will not cause the machine running FW1-LogGrabber to initiate DNS requests, but the name resolution will be done directly on the FW1 machine.

This is the default behavior of FW1-LogGrabber which can be disabled by using `--no-resolve`. That option will cause IP addresses to be displayed in log output instead of names.

#### Checkpoint firewall version

The default FW1 version, for which this tool is being developed, is Checkpoint FW1 5.0 (NG) and above. If no other version is explicitly specified, the default version is `--ng`.

The option `--2000` has to be used if you want to connect to older Checkpoint FW1 4.1 (2000) firewalls. You should keep in mind that some options are not available for non-NG firewalls; these include `--auth`, `--showfiles`, `--auditlog` and some more.

#### Online and Online-Resume modes

Using `--online` mode, FW1-LogGrabber starts output of logging data at the end of the specified logfile (or `fw.log` if no logfile name has been specified). This mode is mainly used for continuously processing FW1 log data and continues to display log entries also after scheduled and manual log switches. If you use `--logfile` to specify another logfile to be processed, you have to consider that no data will be shown, if the file isn't active anymore.

The `--online-resume` mode is similar to the above online mode, but starts output of logging data at the last known processed position (which is stored inside a cursor).

In contrast to online mode, when using `--offline` mode FW1-LogGrabber quits after having displayed the last log entry. This is the default behavior and is mainly used for analysis of historic log data.

#### Audit and normal logs

Using the `--auditlog` mode, the content of the audit logfile (`fw.adtlog`) can be displayed. This includes administrator actions and uses different fields than normal log data.

The default `--normallog` mode of FW1-LogGrabber processes normal FW1 logfiles. In contrast to the `--auditlog` option, no administrative actions are displayed in this mode, but all regular log data is.

#### Filtering

Filter rules provide the possibility to display only log entries that match a given set of rules. There can be specified one or more filter rules using one or multiple `--filter` arguments on the command line.

All individual filter rules are related by OR. That means a log entry will be displayed if at least one of the filter rules matches. You can specify multiple argument values by separating the values by `,` (comma).

Within one filter rule, there can be specified multiple arguments that have to be separated by `;` (semi-colon). All these arguments are related by AND. That means a filter rule matches a given log entry only, if all of the filter arguments match.

If you specify `!=` instead of `=` between the name and value of the filter argument, you can negate the name/value pair.

For arguments that expect IP addresses, you can specify either a single IP address, multiple IP addresses separated by `,` (comma), or a network address with netmask (e.g. `10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0`). Currently, it is not possible to specify a network address and a single IP address within the same filter argument.

#### Supported filter arguments

Normal mode:

```bash
action=<ctl|accept|drop|reject|encrypt|decrypt|keyinst>
dst=<IP address>
endtime=<YYYYMMDDhhmmss>
orig=<IP address>
product=<VPN-1 & FireWall-1|SmartDefense>
proto=<icmp|tcp|udp>
rule=<rulenumber|startrule-endrule>
service=<portnumber|startport-endport>
src=<IP address>
starttime=<YYYYMMDDhhmmss>
```

Audit mode:

```bash
action=<ctl|accept|drop|reject|encrypt|decrypt|keyinst>
administrator=<string>
endtime=<YYYYMMDDhhmmss>
orig=<IP address>
product=<SmartDashboard|Policy Editor|SmartView Tracker|SmartView Status|SmartView Monitor|System Monitor|cpstat_monitor|SmartUpdate|CPMI Client>
starttime=<YYYYMMDDhhmmss>
```

#### Example filters

Display all dropped connections:

```bash
--filter "action=drop"
```

Display all dropped and rejected connections:

```bash
--filter "action=drop,reject"
--filter "action!=accept"
```

Display all log entries generated by rules 20 to 23:

```bash
--filter "rule=20,21,22,23"
--filter "rule=20-23"
```

Display all log entries generated by rules 20 to 23, 30 or 40 to 42:

```bash
--filter "rule=20-23,30,40-42"
```

Display all log entries to `10.1.1.1` and `10.1.1.2`:

```bash
--filter "dst=10.1.1.1,10.1.1.2"
```

Display all log entries from `192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0`:

```bash
--filter "src=192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0"
```

Display all log entries starting from `2004/03/02 14:00:00`:

```bash
--filter "starttime=20040302140000"
```

#### Checkpoint device configuration

Modify `$FWDIR/conf/fwopsec.conf` and define the port to be used for authenticated LEA connections (e.g. 18184):

```bash
lea_server port 0 
lea_server auth_port 18184 
lea_server auth_type sslca
```

Restart in order to activate changes:

```bash
cpstop; cpstart
```

Create a new OPSEC Application Object with the following details:

```bash
Name: e.g. myleaclient
Vendor: User Defined
Server Entities: None
Client Entities: LEA
```

Initialize Secure Internal Communication (SIC) for recently created OPSEC Application Object and enter (and remember) the activation key (e.g. `def456`).

Write down the DN of the recently created OPSEC Application Object; this is your Client Distinguished Name, which you need later on.

Open the object of your FW1 management server and write down the DN of that object; this is the Server Distinguished Name, which you will need later on.

Add a rule to the policy to allow the port defined above as well as port 18210/tcp (FW1_ica_pull) in order to allow pulling of PKCS#12 certificate by the FW1-LogGrabber machine from the FW1 management server. Port 18210/tcp can be shut down after the communication between FW1-LogGrabber and the FW1 management server has been established successfully.

Finally, install the policy.

#### FW1-LogGrabber configuration

Modify `$LOGGRABBER_CONFIG_PATH/lea.conf` and define the IP address of your FW1 management station (e.g. `10.1.1.1`) as well as port (e.g. `18184`), authentication type and SIC names for authenticated LEA
connections. You can get the SIC names from the object properties of your LEA client object, respectively the
Management Station object (see above for details about Client DN and Server DN).

```bash
lea_server ip 10.1.1.1 
lea_server auth_port 18184 
lea_server auth_type sslca 
opsec_sslca_file opsec.p12 
opsec_sic_name "CN=myleaclient,O=cpmodule..gysidy"
lea_server opsec_entity_sic_name "cn=cp_mgmt,o=cpmodule..gysidy"
```

Get the tool `opsec_pull_cert` either from `opsec-tools.tar.gz` from the project home page or directly from the OPSEC SDK. This tool is needed to establish the Secure Internal Communication (SIC) between FW1-LogGrabber and the FW1 management server.

Get the clients certificate from the management station (e.g. `10.1.1.1`). The activation key has to be the same as specified before in the firewall policy. After that, copy the resulting PKCS#12 file (default name `opsec.p12`) to your FW1-LogGrabber directory.

```bash
opsec_pull_cert -h 10.1.1.1 -n myleaclient -p def456
```

#### Authenticated SSL OPSEC connections

#### Checkpoint device configuration

Modify `$FWDIR/conf/fwopsec.conf` and define the port to be used for authenticated LEA connections (e.g. 18184):

```bash
lea_server port 0 
lea_server auth_port 18184 
lea_server auth_type ssl_opsec
```

Restart in order to activate changes:

```bash
cpstop; cpstart
```

Set a password (e.g. `abc123`) for the LEA client (e.g. `10.1.1.2`):

```bash
fw putkey -ssl -p abc123 10.1.1.2
```

Create a new OPSEC Application Object with the following details:

```bash
Name: e.g. myleaclient 
Vendor: User Defined 
Server Entities: None 
Client Entities: LEA
```

Initialize Secure Internal Communication (SIC) for recently created OPSEC Application Object and enter (and remember) the activation key (e.g. `def456`).

Write down the DN of the recently created OPSEC Application Object; this is your Client Distinguished Name, which you need later on.

Open the object of your FW1 management server and write down the DN of that object; this is the Server Distinguished Name, which you will need later on.

Add a rule to the policy to allow the port defined above as well as port 18210/tcp (FW1_ica_pull) in order to allow pulling of PKCS#12 certificate from the FW1-LogGrabber machine to the FW1 management server. The port 18210/tcp can be shut down after the communication between FW1-LogGrabber and the FW1 management server has
been established successfully.

Finally, install the policy.

#### FW1-LogGrabber configuration

Modify `$LOGGRABBER_CONFIG_PATH/lea.conf` and define the IP address of your FW1 management station (e.g. `10.1.1.1`) as well as port (e.g. `18184`), authentication type and SIC names for authenticated LEA connections. The SIC names you can get from the object properties of your LEA client object respectively the Management Station object (see above for details about Client DN and Server DN).

```bash
lea_server ip 10.1.1.1 
lea_server auth_port 18184 
lea_server auth_type ssl_opsec 
opsec_sslca_file opsec.p12 
opsec_sic_name "CN=myleaclient,O=cpmodule..gysidy"
lea_server opsec_entity_sic_name "cn=cp_mgmt,o=cpmodule..gysidy"
```

Set password for the connection to the LEA server. The password has to be the same as specified on the LEA server.

```bash
opsec_putkey -ssl -p abc123 10.1.1.1
```

Get the tool `opsec_pull_cert` either from `opsec-tools.tar.gz` from the project home page or directly from the OPSEC SDK. This tool is needed to establish the Secure Internal Communication (SIC) between FW1-LogGrabber and the FW1 management server.

Get the clients certificate from the management station (e.g. `10.1.1.1`). The activation key has to be the same as specified before in the firewall policy.

```bash
opsec_pull_cert -h 10.1.1.1 -n myleaclient -p def456
```

#### Authenticated OPSEC connections

#### Checkpoint device configuration

Modify `$FWDIR/conf/fwopsec.conf` and define the port to be used for authenticated LEA connections (e.g. 18184):

```bash
lea_server port 0 
lea_server auth_port 18184 
lea_server auth_type auth_opsec
```

Restart in order to activate changes

```bash
fwstop; fwstart
```

Set a password (e.g. `abc123`) for the LEA client (e.g. `10.1.1.2`).

```bash
fw putkey -opsec -p abc123 10.1.1.2
```

Add a rule to the policy to allow the port defined above from the FW1-LogGrabber machine to the FW1 management
server.

Finally, install the policy.

#### FW1-LogGrabber configuration

Modify `$LOGGRABBER_CONFIG_PATH/lea.conf` and define the IP address of your FW1 management station (e.g. `10.1.1.1`) as well as the port (e.g. 18184) and authentication type for authenticated LEA connections:

```bash
lea_server ip 10.1.1.1 
lea_server auth_port 18184 
lea_server auth_type auth_opsec
```

Set password for the connection to the LEA server. The password has to be the same as specified on the LEA server.

```bash
opsec_putkey -p abc123 10.1.1.1
```

#### Unauthenticated connections

#### Checkpoint device configuration

Modify `$FWDIR/conf/fwopsec.conf` and define the port to be used for unauthenticated LEA connections (e.g. 50001):

```bash
lea_server port 50001 
lea_server auth_port 0
```

Restart in order to activate changes:

```bash
fwstop; fwstart  # for 4.1
cpstop; cpstart  # for NG
```

Add a rule to the policy to allow the port defined above from the FW1-LogGrabber machine to the FW1 management
server.

Finally, install the policy.

#### FW1-LogGrabber configuration

Modify `$LOGGRABBER_CONFIG_PATH/lea.conf` and define the IP address of your FW1 management station (e.g. `10.1.1.1`) and port (e.g. `50001`) for unauthenticated LEA connections:

```bash
lea_server ip 10.1.1.1 
lea_server port 50001
```

### Logstash - Input SDEE

This [Logstash](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash) input plugin allows you to call a Cisco SDEE/CIDEE HTTP API, decode the output of it into event(s), and send them on their merry way. The idea behind this plugins came from a need to gather events from Cisco security devices and feed them to ELK stack

#### Download

Only support for Logstash core 5.6.4.

Download link: https://rubygems.org/gems/logstash-input-sdee

#### Installation

```bash
gem install logstash-input-sdee-0.7.8.gem
```

#### Configuration

You need to import host SSL certificate in Java trust store to be able to connect to Cisco IPS device.

- Get server certificate from IPS device:

  ```bash
  echo | openssl s_client -connect ciscoips:443 2>&1 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > cert.pem
  ```

- Import it into Java ca certs:

  ```bash
  $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -importcert -alias ciscoips -file cert.pem
  ```

- Verify if import was successful:

  ```bash
  $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -list
  ```

- Setup the Logstash input config with SSL connection:

  ```bash
  input {
    sdee { 
      interval => 60  
      http => { 
        truststore_password => "changeit" 
        url => "https://10.0.2.1"  
        auth => {
          user => "cisco"
          password => "p@ssw0rd"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Logstash - Input XML

To download xml files via Logstash use input "file", and set the location of the files in the configuration file:

```bash
file {
       path => [ "/etc/logstash/files/*.xml" ]
       mode => "read"
  }
```

The XML filter takes a field that contains XML and expands it into an actual datastructure.

```bash
filter {
      xml {
        source => "message"
      }
    }
```

More configuration options you can find: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/6.8/plugins-filters-xml.html#plugins-filters-xml-options

### Logstash - Input WMI

The Logstash input **wmi** allow to collect data from WMI query. This is useful for collecting performance metrics and other data which is accessible via WMI on a Windows host.

#### Installation

For plugins not bundled by default, it is easy to install by running:

`/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-input-wmi`

#### Configuration

Configuration example:

```ruby
input {
      wmi {
        query => "select * from Win32_Process"
        interval => 10
      }
      wmi {
        query => "select PercentProcessorTime from Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_Processor where name = '_Total'"
      }
      wmi { # Connect to a remote host
        query => "select * from Win32_Process"
        host => "MyRemoteHost"
        user => "mydomain\myuser"
        password => "Password"
      }
    }
```

      remove_field => [ "[dst][geoip][ip]" ]
    }
  }

}
```

### Logstash - avoiding duplicate documents

To avoid duplicating the same documents, e.g. if the collector receives the entire event log file on restart, prepare the Logstash filter as follows:

1. Use the **fingerprint** Logstash filter to create consistent hashes of one or more fields whose values are unique for the document and store the result in a new field, for example:

   ```bash
   fingerprint {
                           source => [ "log_name", "record_number" ]
                           target => "generated_id"
                           method => "SHA1"
                   }
   
   ```

   - source - The name(s) of the source field(s) whose contents will be used to create the fingerprint
   - target - The name of the field where the generated fingerprint will be stored. Any current contents of that field will be overwritten.
   - method - If set to `SHA1`, `SHA256`, `SHA384`, `SHA512`, or `MD5` and a key is set, the cryptographic hash function with the same name will be used to generate the fingerprint. When a key set, the keyed-hash (HMAC) digest function will be used.

2. In the **elasticsearch** output set the **document_id** as the value of the **generated_id** field:

   ```bash
   elasticsearch {
                   hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
                   user => "logserver"
                   password => "logserver"
                   index => "syslog_wec-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
                   document_id => "%{generated_id}"
           }
   ```

   - document_id - The document ID for the index. Useful for overwriting existing entries in Elasticsearch with the same ID.

Documents having the same document_id will be indexed only once.

### Logstash data enrichment

It is possible to enrich the events that go to the logstash filters with additional fields, the values of which come from the following sources:

- databases, using the `jdbc` plugin;
- Active Directory or OpenLdap, using the `logstash-filter-ldap` plugin;
- dictionary files, using the `translate` plugin;
- external systems using their API, e.g. OP5 Monitor/Nagios

#### Filter `jdbc`

This filter executes a SQL query and store the result set in the field specified as `target`. It will cache the results locally in an LRU cache with expiry.

For example, you can load a row based on an id in the event:

```bahs
filter {
  jdbc_streaming {
    jdbc_driver_library => "/path/to/mysql-connector-java-5.1.34-bin.jar"
    jdbc_driver_class => "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    jdbc_connection_string => "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase"
    jdbc_user => "me"
    jdbc_password => "secret"
    statement => "select * from WORLD.COUNTRY WHERE Code = :code"
    parameters => { "code" => "country_code"}
    target => "country_details"
  }
}
```

More about `jdbc` plugin parameters: [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/6.8/plugins-filters-jdbc_streaming.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/6.8/plugins-filters-jdbc_streaming.html#plugins-filters-jdbc_streaming-prepared_statements)

#### Filter `logstash-filter-ldap`

#### Download and installation

[https://github.com/Transrian/logstash-filter-ldap](https://github.com/Transrian/logstash-filter-ldap)

#### Configuration

The **logstash-filter-ldap** filter will add fields queried from a ldap server to the event.
The fields will be stored in a variable called **target**, that you can modify in the configuration file.

If an error occurs during the process tha **tags** array of the event is updated with either:

- **LDAP_ERROR** tag: Problem while connecting to the server: bad *host, port, username, password, or search_dn* -> Check the error message and your configuration.
- **LDAP_NOT_FOUND** tag: Object wasn't found.

If error logging is enabled a field called **error** will also be added to the event.
It will contain more details about the problem.

#### Input event

```ruby
{
    "@timestamp" => 2018-02-25T10:04:22.338Z,
    "@version" => "1",
    "myUid" => "u501565"
}
```

#### Logstash filter

```ruby

#### Buffer

Like all filters, this filter treat only 1 event at a time.
This can lead to some slowing down of the pipeline speed due to the network round-trip time, and high network I/O.

A buffer can be set to mitigate this.

Currently, there is only one basic **"memory"** buffer.

You can enable / disable use of buffer with the option **use_cache**.

#### Memory Buffer

This buffer **store** data fetched from the LDAP server **in RAM**, and can be configured with two parameters:

- *cache_memory_duration*: duration (in s) before a cache entry is refreshed if hit.
- *cache_memory_size*: number of tuple (identifier, attributes) that the buffer can contains.

Older cache values than your TTL will be removed from cache.

#### Persistant cache buffer

For the only buffer for now, you will be able to save it to disk periodically.

Some specificities :

  - for *the memory cache*, TTL will be reset

Two parameters are required:

  - *disk_cache_filepath*: path on disk of this backup
  - *disk_cache_schedule*: schedule (every X time unit) of this backup. Please check [here](https://github.com/floraison/fugit) for the syntax of this parameter.

#### Filter `translate`

A general search and replace tool that uses a configured hash and/or a file to determine replacement values. Currently supported are YAML, JSON, and CSV files. Each dictionary item is a key value pair.

You can specify dictionary entries in one of two ways:

- The dictionary configuration item can contain a hash representing the mapping.

```ruby
filter {
      translate {
        field => "[http_status]"
        destination => "[http_status_description]"
        dictionary => {
          "100" => "Continue"
          "101" => "Switching Protocols"
          "200" => "OK"
          "500" => "Server Error"
        }
        fallback => "I'm a teapot"
      }
    }
```

- An external file (readable by logstash) may be specified in the `dictionary_path` configuration item:

```ruby
filter {
  translate {
    dictionary_path => "/etc/logstash/lists/instance_cpu.yml"
    field => "InstanceType"
    destination => "InstanceCPUCount"
    refresh_behaviour => "replace"
  }
}
```

​Sample dictionary file:

```yml
"c4.4xlarge": "16"
"c5.xlarge": "4"
"m1.medium": "1"
"m3.large": "2"
"m3.medium": "1"
"m4.2xlarge": "8"
"m4.large": "2"
"m4.xlarge": "4"
"m5a.xlarge": "4"
"m5d.xlarge": "4"
"m5.large": "2"
"m5.xlarge": "4"
"r3.2xlarge": "8"
"r3.xlarge": "4"
"r4.xlarge": "4"
"r5.2xlarge": "8"
"r5.xlarge": "4"
"t2.large": "2"
"t2.medium": "2"
"t2.micro": "1"
"t2.nano": "1"
"t2.small": "1"
"t2.xlarge": "4"
"t3.medium": "2"
```

#### External API

A simple filter that checks if an IP (from **PublicIpAddress** field) address exists in an external system. The result is written to the **op5exists** field. Then, using a grok filter, the number of occurrences is decoded and put into the **op5count** field.

```ruby
ruby {
  code => '
    checkip = event.get("PublicIpAddress")
    output=`curl -s -k -u monitor:monitor "https://192.168.1.1/api/filter/count?query=%5Bhosts%5D%28address%20~~%20%22# {checkip}%22%20%29" 2>&1`
    event.set("op5exists", "#{output}")
  '
}
grok {
  match => { "op5exists" => [ ".*\:%{NUMBER:op5count}" ] }
}
```

#### Mathematical calculations

Using Logstash filters, you can perform mathematical calculations for field values and save the results to a new field.

Application example:

```bash
filter {
   ruby { code => 'event.set("someField", event.get("field1") + event.get("field2"))' }
}
```

### Logstash - Output to Elasticsearch

This output plugin sends all data to the local Elasticsearch instance and create indexes:

```bash
output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => [ "127.0.0.1:9200" ]
    index => "%{type}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
    user => "logstash"
    password => "logstash"
  }
}
```

### Logstash plugin for "naemon beat"

    }
}
    
filter {
    if [type] == "naemon" {
        grok {
            patterns_dir => [ "/etc/logstash/patterns" ]

        }
    }
}
    
output {
  # Single index
#    if [type] == "naemon" {
#        elasticsearch {
#            hosts => ["ELASTICSEARCH_HOST:ES_PORT"]
#            index => "naemon-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
#        }
#    }
   
  # Separate indexes
  if [type] == "naemon" {
    if "_grokparsefailure" in [tags] {
      elasticsearch {
        hosts => ["ELASTICSEARCH_HOST:ES_PORT"]
        index => "naemongrokfailure"
      }
    }
    else {
      elasticsearch {
        hosts => ["ELASTICSEARCH_HOST:ES_PORT"]
        index => "naemon-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
      }

### Logstash plugin for LDAP data enrichement

1. Download logstash plugin with dependencies ![logstash-filter-ldap-0.2.4.zip](/files/logstash-filter-ldap-0.2.4.zip) and upload files to your server.

2. Unzip file.

3. Install logstash plugin.

    ```/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install /directory/to/file/logstash-filter-ldap-0.2.4.gem```

4. Create new file in beats pipeline. To do this, go to beats folder (/etc/logstash/conf.d/beats) and create new config file, for example ```031-filter-ldap-enrichement.conf```

5. Below is an example of the contents of the configuration file:

    ```bash
    filter {
      ldap {
        identifier_value => "%{[winlog][event_data][TargetUserName]}"
        identifier_key => "sAMAccountName"
        identifier_type => "person"
        host => "10.0.0.1"
        ldap_port => "389"
        username => "user"
        password => "pass"
        search_dn => "OU=example,DC=example"
        enable_error_logging => true
        attributes => ['sAMAccountType','lastLogon','badPasswordTime']
      }
    }
    ```

6. Fields description

    ```bash
    identifier_value - Identifier of the value to search. If identifier type is uid, then the value should be the uid to search for.
    identifier_key - Type of the identifier to search.
    identifier_type - Object class of the object to search.
    host - LDAP server host adress.
    ldap_port - LDAP server port for non-ssl connection.
    username - Username to use for search in the database.
    password - Password of the account linked to previous username.
    search_dn - Domain name in which search inside the ldap database (usually your userdn or groupdn).
    enable_error_logging - When there is a problem with the connection with the LDAP database, write reason in the event.
    attributes - List of attributes to get. If not set, all attributes available will be get.
    ```

### Single password in all Logstash outputs

You can set passwords and other Logstash pipeline settings as environment variables. This can be useful if the password was changed for the `logastash` user and it must be to update in the configuration files.

Configuration steps:

1. Create the service file:

    ```bash
    mkdir –p /etc/systemd/system/logstash.service.d
    vi /etc/systemd/system/logstash.service.d/logstash.conf
    
    [Service]
    Environment="ELASTICSEARCH_ES_USER=logserver"
    Environment="ELASTICSEARCH_ES_PASSWD=logserver"
    ```

1. Reload systemctl daemon:

    ```bash
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

1. Sample definition of Logstash output pipline seciotn:

    ```bash
    output  {
      elasticsearch {
        index => "test-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
        user => "${ELASTICSEARCH_ES_USER:elastic}"
        password => "${ELASTICSEARCH_ES_PASSWD:changeme}"
      }
    }
    ```

### Multiline codec

The original goal of this codec was to allow joining of multiline messages from files into a single event. For example, joining Java exception and stacktrace messages into a single event.

```conf
    input {
      stdin {
        codec => multiline {
          pattern => "pattern, a regexp"
          negate => "true" or "false"
          what => "previous" or "next"
        }
      }
    }
```

```conf
    input {
      file {
        path => "/var/log/someapp.log"
        codec => multiline {
          # Grok pattern names are valid! :)
          pattern => "^%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601} "
          negate => true
          what => "previous"
        }
      }
    }
```

## SQL/PPL API

Use the SQL and PPL API to send queries to the SQL plugin. Use the `_sql` endpoint to send queries in SQL, and the `_ppl` endpoint to send queries in PPL. For both of these, you can also use the `_explain` endpoint to translate your query into [OpenSearch domain-specific language](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/query-dsl/) (DSL) or to troubleshoot errors.

A POST request to the `_plugins/_sql/_explain` or `_plugins/_ppl/_explain` endpoint returns [OpenSearch domain-specific language](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/query-dsl/) (DSL) in JSON format, explaining the query.
You can execute the explain API operation either in command line using `curl` or in the Dashboards console, like in the example below. 

#### Sample explain request for an SQL query

```json
POST _plugins/_sql/_explain
{
  "query": "SELECT firstname, lastname FROM accounts WHERE age > 20"
}
```

#### Sample SQL query explain response

```json
{
  "root": {
    "name": "ProjectOperator",
    "description": {
      "fields": "[firstname, lastname]"
    },
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "OpenSearchIndexScan",
        "description": {
          "request": """OpenSearchQueryRequest(indexName=accounts, sourceBuilder={"from":0,"size":200,"timeout":"1m","query":{"range":{"age":{"from":20,"to":null,"include_lower":false,"include_upper":true,"boost":1.0}}},"_source":{"includes":["firstname","lastname"],"excludes":[]},"sort":[{"_doc":{"order":"asc"}}]}, searchDone=false)"""
        },
        "children": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Sample explain request for a PPL query

```json
POST _plugins/_ppl/_explain
{
  "query" : "source=accounts | fields firstname, lastname"
}
```

#### Sample PPL query explain response

```json
{
  "root": {
    "name": "ProjectOperator",
    "description": {
      "fields": "[firstname, lastname]"
    },
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "OpenSearchIndexScan",
        "description": {
          "request": """OpenSearchQueryRequest(indexName=accounts, sourceBuilder={"from":0,"size":200,"timeout":"1m","_source":{"includes":["firstname","lastname"],"excludes":[]}}, searchDone=false)"""
        },
        "children": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For queries that require post-processing, the `explain` response includes a query plan in addition to the Energy Logserver DSL. For those queries that don't require post processing, you can see a complete DSL.

#### Paginating results

To get back a paginated response, use the `fetch_size` parameter. The value of `fetch_size` should be greater than 0. The default value is 1,000. A value of 0 will fall back to a non-paginated response.

The `fetch_size` parameter is only supported for the `jdbc` response format.
{: .note }

#### Example

The following request contains an SQL query and specifies to return five results at a time:

```json
POST _plugins/_sql/
{
  "fetch_size" : 5,
  "query" : "SELECT firstname, lastname FROM accounts WHERE age > 20 ORDER BY state ASC"
}
```

The response contains all the fields that a query without `fetch_size` would contain, and a `cursor` field that is used to retrieve subsequent pages of results:

```json
{
  "schema": [
    {
      "name": "firstname",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "lastname",
      "type": "text"
    }
  ],
  "cursor": "d:eyJhIjp7fSwicyI6IkRYRjFaWEo1UVc1a1JtVjBZMmdCQUFBQUFBQUFBQU1XZWpkdFRFRkZUMlpTZEZkeFdsWnJkRlZoYnpaeVVRPT0iLCJjIjpbeyJuYW1lIjoiZmlyc3RuYW1lIiwidHlwZSI6InRleHQifSx7Im5hbWUiOiJsYXN0bmFtZSIsInR5cGUiOiJ0ZXh0In1dLCJmIjo1LCJpIjoiYWNjb3VudHMiLCJsIjo5NTF9",
  "total": 956,
  "datarows": [
    [
      "Cherry",
      "Carey"
    ],
    [
      "Lindsey",
      "Hawkins"
    ],
    [
      "Sargent",
      "Powers"
    ],
    [
      "Campos",
      "Olsen"
    ],
    [
      "Savannah",
      "Kirby"
    ]
  ],
  "size": 5,
  "status": 200
}
```

To fetch subsequent pages, use the `cursor` from the previous response:

```json
POST /_plugins/_sql 
{
   "cursor": "d:eyJhIjp7fSwicyI6IkRYRjFaWEo1UVc1a1JtVjBZMmdCQUFBQUFBQUFBQU1XZWpkdFRFRkZUMlpTZEZkeFdsWnJkRlZoYnpaeVVRPT0iLCJjIjpbeyJuYW1lIjoiZmlyc3RuYW1lIiwidHlwZSI6InRleHQifSx7Im5hbWUiOiJsYXN0bmFtZSIsInR5cGUiOiJ0ZXh0In1dLCJmIjo1LCJpIjoiYWNjb3VudHMiLCJsIjo5NTF9"
}
```

The next response contains only the `datarows` of the results and a new `cursor`.

```json
{
  "cursor": "d:eyJhIjp7fSwicyI6IkRYRjFaWEo1UVc1a1JtVjBZMmdCQUFBQUFBQUFBQU1XZWpkdFRFRkZUMlpTZEZkeFdsWnJkRlZoYnpaeVVRPT0iLCJjIjpbeyJuYW1lIjoiZmlyc3RuYW1lIiwidHlwZSI6InRleHQifSx7Im5hbWUiOiJsYXN0bmFtZSIsInR5cGUiOiJ0ZXh0In1dLCJmIjo1LCJpIjoiYWNjb3VudHMabcde12345",
  "datarows": [
    [
      "Abbey",
      "Karen"
    ],
    [
      "Chen",
      "Ken"
    ],
    [
      "Ani",
      "Jade"
    ],
    [
      "Peng",
      "Hu"
    ],
    [
      "John",
      "Doe"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The `datarows` can have more than the `fetch_size` number of records in case nested fields are flattened. 
{: .note }

The last page of results has only `datarows` and no `cursor`. The `cursor` context is automatically cleared on the last page.

To explicitly clear the cursor context, use the `_plugins/_sql/close` endpoint operation:

```json
POST /_plugins/_sql/close 
{
   "cursor": "d:eyJhIjp7fSwicyI6IkRYRjFaWEo1UVc1a1JtVjBZMmdCQUFBQUFBQUFBQU1XZWpkdFRFRkZUMlpTZEZkeFdsWnJkRlZoYnpaeVVRPT0iLCJjIjpbeyJuYW1lIjoiZmlyc3RuYW1lIiwidHlwZSI6InRleHQifSx7Im5hbWUiOiJsYXN0bmFtZSIsInR5cGUiOiJ0ZXh0In1dLCJmIjo1LCJpIjoiYWNjb3VudHMiLCJsIjo5NTF9"
}'
```

The response is an acknowledgement from Energy Logserver:

```json
{"succeeded":true}
```

#### Filtering results

You can use the `filter` parameter to add more conditions to the Energy Logserver DSL directly.

The following SQL query returns the names and account balances of all customers. The results are then filtered to contain only those customers with less than $10,000 balance. 

```json
POST /_plugins/_sql/ 
{
  "query" : "SELECT firstname, lastname, balance FROM accounts",
  "filter" : {
    "range" : {
      "balance" : {
        "lt" : 10000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The response contains the matching results:

```json
{
  "schema": [
    {
      "name": "firstname",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "lastname",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "balance",
      "type": "long"
    }
  ],
  "total": 2,
  "datarows": [
    [
      "Hattie",
      "Bond",
      5686
    ],
    [
      "Dale",
      "Adams",
      4180
    ]
  ],
  "size": 2,
  "status": 200
}
```

You can use the Explain API to see how this query is executed against Energe Logserver:

```json
POST /_plugins/_sql/_explain 
{
  "query" : "SELECT firstname, lastname, balance FROM accounts",
  "filter" : {
    "range" : {
      "balance" : {
        "lt" : 10000
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

The response contains the Boolean query in Enegry Logserver DSL that corresponds to the query above:

```json
{
  "from": 0,
  "size": 200,
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": [{
        "bool": {
          "filter": [{
            "range": {
              "balance": {
                "from": null,
                "to": 10000,
                "include_lower": true,
                "include_upper": false,
                "boost": 1.0
              }
            }
          }],
          "adjust_pure_negative": true,
          "boost": 1.0
        }
      }],
      "adjust_pure_negative": true,
      "boost": 1.0
    }
  },
  "_source": {
    "includes": [
      "firstname",
      "lastname",
      "balance"
    ],
    "excludes": []
  }
}
```

#### Using parameters

You can use the `parameters` field to pass parameter values to a prepared SQL query.

The following explain operation uses an SQL query with an `age` parameter:

```json
POST /_plugins/_sql/_explain 
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE age = ?",
  "parameters": [{
    "type": "integer",
    "value": 30
  }]
}
```

The response contains the Boolean query in Enegry Logserver DSL that corresponds to the SQL query above:

```json
{
  "from": 0,
  "size": 200,
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": [{
        "bool": {
          "must": [{
            "term": {
              "age": {
                "value": 30,
                "boost": 1.0
              }
            }
          }],
          "adjust_pure_negative": true,
          "boost": 1.0
        }
      }],
      "adjust_pure_negative": true,
      "boost": 1.0
    }
  }
}

```

### Response formats

The SQL plugin provides the `jdbc`, `csv`, `raw`, and `json` response formats that are useful for different purposes. The `jdbc` format is widely used because it provides the schema information and adds more functionality, such as pagination. Besides the JDBC driver, various clients can benefit from a detailed and well-formatted response.

#### JDBC format

By default, the SQL plugin returns the response in the standard JDBC format. This format is provided for the JDBC driver and clients that need both the schema and the result set to be well formatted.

#### Example request

The following query does not specify the response format, so the format is set to `jdbc`:

```json
POST _plugins/_sql
{
  "query" : "SELECT firstname, lastname, age FROM accounts ORDER BY age LIMIT 2"
}
```

#### Example response

In the response, the `schema` contains the field names and types, and the `datarows` field contains the result set:

```json
{
  "schema": [{
      "name": "firstname",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "lastname",
      "type": "text"
    },
    {
      "name": "age",
      "type": "long"
    }
  ],
  "total": 4,
  "datarows": [
    [
      "Nanette",
      "Bates",
      28
    ],
    [
      "Amber",
      "Duke",
      32
    ]
  ],
  "size": 2,
  "status": 200
}
```

If an error of any type occurs, Enegry Logserver returns the error message.

The following query searches for a non-existent field `unknown`:

```json
POST /_plugins/_sql
{
  "query" : "SELECT unknown FROM accounts"
}
```

The response contains the error message and the cause of the error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "reason": "Invalid SQL query",
    "details": "Field [unknown] cannot be found or used here.",
    "type": "SemanticAnalysisException"
  },
  "status": 400
}
```

#### Enegry Logserver DSL JSON format

If you set the format to `json`, the original Enegry Logserver response is returned in JSON format. Because this is the native response from Enegry Logserver, extra effort is needed to parse and interpret it.

#### Example request

The following query sets the response format to `json`:

```json
POST _plugins/_sql?format=json
{
  "query" : "SELECT firstname, lastname, age FROM accounts ORDER BY age LIMIT 2"
}
```

#### Example response

The response is the original response from Enegry Logserver:

```json
{
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "failed": 0,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "hits": [{
        "_index": "accounts",
        "_type": "account",
        "_source": {
          "firstname": "Nanette",
          "age": 28,
          "lastname": "Bates"
        },
        "_id": "13",
        "sort": [
          28
        ],
        "_score": null
      },
      {
        "_index": "accounts",
        "_type": "account",
        "_source": {
          "firstname": "Amber",
          "age": 32,
          "lastname": "Duke"
        },
        "_id": "1",
        "sort": [
          32
        ],
        "_score": null
      }
    ],
    "total": {
      "value": 4,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": null
  },
  "took": 100,
  "timed_out": false
}
```

#### CSV format

You can also specify to return results in CSV format. 

#### Example request

```json
POST /_plugins/_sql?format=csv
{
  "query" : "SELECT firstname, lastname, age FROM accounts ORDER BY age"
}
```

#### Example response

```text
firstname,lastname,age
Nanette,Bates,28
Amber,Duke,32
Dale,Adams,33
Hattie,Bond,36
```
#### Sanitizing results in CSV format

By default, Enegry Logserver sanitizes header cells (field names) and data cells (field contents) according to the following rules:

- If a cell starts with `+`, `-`, `=` , or `@`, the sanitizer inserts a single quote (`'`) at the start of the cell.
- If a cell contains one or more commas (`,`), the sanitizer surrounds the cell with double quotes (`"`).

#### Example 

The following query indexes a document with cells that either start with special characters or contain commas:

```json
PUT /userdata/_doc/1?refresh=true
{
  "+firstname": "-Hattie",
  "=lastname": "@Bond",
  "address": "671 Bristol Street, Dente, TN"
}
```

You can use the query below to request results in CSV format:

```json
POST /_plugins/_sql?format=csv
{
  "query" : "SELECT * FROM userdata"
}
```

In the response, cells that start with special characters are prefixed with `'`. The cell that has commas is surrounded with quotation marks:

```text
'+firstname,'=lastname,address
'Hattie,'@Bond,"671 Bristol Street, Dente, TN"
```

To skip sanitizing, set the `sanitize` query parameter to false:

```json
POST /_plugins/_sql?format=csvandsanitize=false
{
  "query" : "SELECT * FROM userdata"
}
```

The response contains the results in the original CSV format:

```text
=lastname,address,+firstname
@Bond,"671 Bristol Street, Dente, TN",-Hattie
```

#### Raw format

You can use the raw format to pipe the results to other command line tools for post-processing.

#### Example request

```json
POST /_plugins/_sql?format=raw
{
  "query" : "SELECT firstname, lastname, age FROM accounts ORDER BY age"
}
```

#### Example response

```text
Nanette|Bates|28
Amber|Duke|32
Dale|Adams|33
Hattie|Bond|36
```

By default, Enegry Logserver sanitizes results in `raw` format according to the following rule:

- If a data cell contains one or more pipe characters (`|`), the sanitizer surrounds the cell with double quotes.

#### Example 

The following query indexes a document with pipe characters (`|`) in its fields:

```json
PUT /userdata/_doc/1?refresh=true
{
  "+firstname": "|Hattie",
  "=lastname": "Bond|",
  "|address": "671 Bristol Street| Dente| TN"
}
```

You can use the query below to request results in `raw` format:

```json
POST /_plugins/_sql?format=raw
{
  "query" : "SELECT * FROM userdata"
}
```

The query returns cells with the `|` character surrounded by quotation marks:

```text
"|address"|=lastname|+firstname
"671 Bristol Street| Dente| TN"|"Bond|"|"|Hattie"
```

## SQL

![OpenSearch Dashboards SQL UI plugin](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/images/sql.png)

#### SQL and Enegry Logserver terminology

Here’s how core SQL concepts map to Enegry Logserver:

SQL | Enegry Logserver
:--- | :---
Table | Index
Row | Document
Column | Field

#### REST API


To use the SQL plugin with your own applications, send requests to the `_plugins/_sql` endpoint:

```json
POST _plugins/_sql
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM my-index LIMIT 50"
}
```

You can query multiple indexes by using a comma-separated list:

```json
POST _plugins/_sql
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM my-index1,myindex2,myindex3 LIMIT 50"
}
```

You can also specify an index pattern with a wildcard expression:

```json
POST _plugins/_sql
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM my-index* LIMIT 50"
}
```

To run the above query in the command line, use the [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) command:

```bash
curl -XPOST https://localhost:9200/_plugins/_sql -u 'admin:admin' -k -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"query": "SELECT * FROM my-index* LIMIT 50"}'
```

You can specify the [response format](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/response-formats) as JDBC, standard Enegry Logserver JSON, CSV, or raw. By default, queries return data in JDBC format. The following query sets the format to JSON:

```json
POST _plugins/_sql?format=json
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM my-index LIMIT 50"
}
```

See the rest of this guide for more information about request parameters, settings, supported operations, and tools.



### Basic queries

Use the `SELECT` clause, along with `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` to search and aggregate data.

Among these clauses, `SELECT` and `FROM` are required, as they specify which fields to retrieve and which indexes to retrieve them from. All other clauses are optional. Use them according to your needs.

##### Syntax

The complete syntax for searching and aggregating data is as follows:

```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] (* | expression) [[AS] alias] [, ...]
FROM index_name
[WHERE predicates]
[GROUP BY expression [, ...]
 [HAVING predicates]]
[ORDER BY expression [IS [NOT] NULL] [ASC | DESC] [, ...]]
[LIMIT [offset, ] size]
```

##### Fundamentals

Apart from the predefined keywords of SQL, the most basic elements are literal and identifiers.
A literal is a numeric, string, date or boolean constant. An identifier is an Enegry Logserver index or field name.
With arithmetic operators and SQL functions, use literals and identifiers to build complex expressions.

Rule `expressionAtom`:

![expressionAtom](media/media/expressionAtom.png)

The expression in turn can be combined into a predicate with logical operator. Use a predicate in the `WHERE` and `HAVING` clause to filter out data by specific conditions.

Rule `expression`:

![expression](media/media/expression.png)

Rule `predicate`:

![expression](media/media/predicate.png)

##### Execution Order

These SQL clauses execute in an order different from how they appear:

```sql
FROM index
 WHERE predicates
  GROUP BY expressions
   HAVING predicates
    SELECT expressions
     ORDER BY expressions
      LIMIT size
```

#### Select

Specify the fields to be retrieved.

##### Syntax

Rule `selectElements`:

![selectElements](media/media/selectElements.png)

Rule `selectElement`:

![selectElements](media/media/selectElement.png)

*Example 1*: Use `*` to retrieve all fields in an index:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM accounts
```

| account_number | firstname | gender | city | balance | employer | state | email | address | lastname | age
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| 1 | Amber | M | Brogan | 39225 | Pyrami | IL | amberduke@pyrami.com | 880 Holmes Lane | Duke | 32
| 16 | Hattie | M | Dante | 5686 | Netagy | TN | hattiebond@netagy.com | 671 Bristol Street | 	Bond | 36
| 13 | Nanette | F | Nogal | 32838 | Quility | VA | nanettebates@quility.com | 789 Madison Street | Bates | 28
| 18 | Dale | M | Orick | 4180 |  | MD | daleadams@boink.com | 467 Hutchinson Court | Adams | 33

*Example 2*: Use field name(s) to retrieve only specific fields:

```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname
FROM accounts
```

| firstname | lastname
| :--- | :---
| Amber | Duke
| Hattie | Bond
| Nanette | Bates
| Dale | Adams

*Example 3*: Use field aliases instead of field names. Field aliases are used to make field names more readable:

```sql
SELECT account_number AS num
FROM accounts
```

| num
:---
| 1
| 6
| 13
| 18

*Example 4*: Use the `DISTINCT` clause to get back only unique field values. You can specify one or more field names:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT age
FROM accounts
```

| age
:---
| 28
| 32
| 33
| 36

#### From

Specify the index that you want search.
You can specify subqueries within the `FROM` clause.

##### Syntax

Rule `tableName`:

![tableName](media/media/tableName.png)

*Example 1*: Use index aliases to query across indexes. To learn about index aliases, see [Index Alias](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/index-alias/).
In this sample query, `acc` is an alias for the `accounts` index:

```sql
SELECT account_number, accounts.age
FROM accounts
```

or

```sql
SELECT account_number, acc.age
FROM accounts acc
```

| account_number | age
| :--- | :---
| 1 | 32
| 6 | 36
| 13 | 28
| 18 | 33

*Example 2*: Use index patterns to query indexes that match a specific pattern:

```sql
SELECT account_number
FROM account*
```

| account_number
:---
| 1
| 6
| 13
| 18

#### Where

Specify a condition to filter the results.

| Operators | Behavior
:--- | :---
`=` | Equal to.
`<>` | Not equal to.
`>` | Greater than.
`<` | Less than.
`>=` | Greater than or equal to.
`<=` | Less than or equal to.
`IN` | Specify multiple `OR` operators.
`BETWEEN` | Similar to a range query. For more information about range queries, see [Range query](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl/term/range/).
`LIKE` | Use for full-text search. For more information about full-text queries.
`IS NULL` | Check if the field value is `NULL`.
`IS NOT NULL` | Check if the field value is `NOT NULL`.

Combine comparison operators (`=`, `<>`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) with boolean operators `NOT`, `AND`, or `OR` to build more complex expressions.

*Example 1*: Use comparison operators for numbers, strings, or dates:

```sql
SELECT account_number
FROM accounts
WHERE account_number = 1
```

| account_number

*Example 2*: Enegry Logserver allows for flexible schema，so documents in an index may have different fields. Use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` to retrieve only missing fields or existing fields. Enegry Logserver does not differentiate between missing fields and fields explicitly set to `NULL`:

```sql
SELECT account_number, employer
FROM accounts
WHERE employer IS NULL
```

| account_number | employer
| :--- | :---
| 18 |

*Example 3*: Deletes a document that satisfies the predicates in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
DELETE FROM accounts
WHERE age > 30
```

#### Group By

Group documents with the same field value into buckets.

*Example 1*: Group by fields:

```sql
SELECT age
FROM accounts
GROUP BY age
```

| id | age
:--- | :---
0 | 28
1 | 32
2 | 33
3 | 36

*Example 2*: Group by field alias:

```sql
SELECT account_number AS num
FROM accounts
GROUP BY num
```

| id | num
:--- | :---
0 | 1
1 | 6
2 | 13
3 | 18

*Example 4*: Use scalar functions in the `GROUP BY` clause:

```sql
SELECT ABS(age) AS a
FROM accounts
GROUP BY ABS(age)
```

| id | a
:--- | :---
0 | 28.0
1 | 32.0
2 | 33.0
3 | 36.0

#### Having

Use the `HAVING` clause to aggregate inside each bucket based on aggregation functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MIN`, and `MAX`).
The `HAVING` clause filters results from the `GROUP BY` clause:

*Example 1*:

```sql
SELECT age, MAX(balance)
FROM accounts
GROUP BY age HAVING MIN(balance) > 10000
```

| id | age | MAX (balance)
:--- | :---
0 | 28 | 32838
1 | 32 | 39225

#### Order By

Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort results into your desired order.

*Example 1*: Use `ORDER BY` to sort by ascending or descending order. Besides regular field names, using `ordinal`, `alias`, or `scalar` functions are supported:

```sql
SELECT account_number
FROM accounts
ORDER BY account_number DESC
```

| account_number
| :---
| 18
| 13
| 6
| 1

*Example 2*: Specify if documents with missing fields are to be put at the beginning or at the end of the results. The default behavior of Enegry Logserver is to return nulls or missing fields at the end. To push them before non-nulls, use the `IS NOT NULL` operator:

```sql
SELECT employer
FROM accounts
ORDER BY employer IS NOT NULL
```

| employer
| :---
||
| Netagy
| Pyrami
| Quility

#### Limit

Specify the maximum number of documents that you want to retrieve. Used to prevent fetching large amounts of data into memory.

*Example 1*: If you pass in a single argument, it's mapped to the `size` parameter in Enegry Logserver and the `from` parameter is set to 0.

```sql
SELECT account_number
FROM accounts
ORDER BY account_number LIMIT 1
```

| account_number
| :---
| 1

*Example 2*: If you pass in two arguments, the first is mapped to the `from` parameter and the second to the `size` parameter in Enegry Logserver. You can use this for simple pagination for small indexes, as it's inefficient for large indexes.
Use `ORDER BY` to ensure the same order between pages:

```sql
SELECT account_number
FROM accounts
ORDER BY account_number LIMIT 1, 1
```

| account_number
| :---
| 6



### Complex queries

Besides simple SFW (`SELECT-FROM-WHERE`) queries, the SQL plugin supports complex queries such as subquery, join, union, and minus. These queries operate on more than one Enegry Logserver index. To examine how these queries execute behind the scenes, use the `explain` operation.


#### Joins

Enegry Logserver SQL supports inner joins, cross joins, and left outer joins.

##### Constraints

Joins have a number of constraints:

1. You can only join two indexes.
1. You must use aliases for indexes (for example, `people p`).
1. Within an ON clause, you can only use AND conditions.
1. In a WHERE statement, don't combine trees that contain multiple indexes. For example, the following statement works:

   ```
   WHERE (a.type1 > 3 OR a.type1 < 0) AND (b.type2 > 4 OR b.type2 < -1)
   ```

   The following statement does not:

   ```
   WHERE (a.type1 > 3 OR b.type2 < 0) AND (a.type1 > 4 OR b.type2 < -1)
   ```

1. You can't use GROUP BY or ORDER BY for results.
1. LIMIT with OFFSET (e.g. `LIMIT 25 OFFSET 25`) is not supported.

##### Description

The `JOIN` clause combines columns from one or more indexes using values common to each.

##### Syntax

Rule `tableSource`:

![tableSource](media/media/tableSource.png)

Rule `joinPart`:

![joinPart](media/media/joinPart.png)

##### Example 1: Inner join

Inner join creates a new result set by combining columns of two indexes based on your join predicates. It iterates the two indexes and compares each document to find the ones that satisfy the join predicates. You can optionally precede the `JOIN` clause with an `INNER` keyword.

The join predicate(s) is specified by the ON clause.

SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  a.account_number, a.firstname, a.lastname,
  e.id, e.name
FROM accounts a
JOIN employees_nested e
 ON a.account_number = e.id
```

Explain:

The `explain` output is complicated, because a `JOIN` clause is associated with two Enegry Logserver DSL queries that execute in separate query planner frameworks. You can interpret it by examining the `Physical Plan` and `Logical Plan` objects.

```json
{
  "Physical Plan" : {
    "Project [ columns=[a.account_number, a.firstname, a.lastname, e.name, e.id] ]" : {
      "Top [ count=200 ]" : {
        "BlockHashJoin[ conditions=( a.account_number = e.id ), type=JOIN, blockSize=[FixedBlockSize with size=10000] ]" : {
          "Scroll [ employees_nested as e, pageSize=10000 ]" : {
            "request" : {
              "size" : 200,
              "from" : 0,
              "_source" : {
                "excludes" : [ ],
                "includes" : [
                  "id",
                  "name"
                ]
              }
            }
          },
          "Scroll [ accounts as a, pageSize=10000 ]" : {
            "request" : {
              "size" : 200,
              "from" : 0,
              "_source" : {
                "excludes" : [ ],
                "includes" : [
                  "account_number",
                  "firstname",
                  "lastname"
                ]
              }
            }
          },
          "useTermsFilterOptimization" : false
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "description" : "Hash Join algorithm builds hash table based on result of first query, and then probes hash table to find matched rows for each row returned by second query",
  "Logical Plan" : {
    "Project [ columns=[a.account_number, a.firstname, a.lastname, e.name, e.id] ]" : {
      "Top [ count=200 ]" : {
        "Join [ conditions=( a.account_number = e.id ) type=JOIN ]" : {
          "Group" : [
            {
              "Project [ columns=[a.account_number, a.firstname, a.lastname] ]" : {
                "TableScan" : {
                  "tableAlias" : "a",
                  "tableName" : "accounts"
                }
              }
            },
            {
              "Project [ columns=[e.name, e.id] ]" : {
                "TableScan" : {
                  "tableAlias" : "e",
                  "tableName" : "employees_nested"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Result set:

| a.account_number | a.firstname | a.lastname | e.id | e.name
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
6 | Hattie | Bond | 6 | Jane Smith

##### Example 2: Cross join

Cross join, also known as cartesian join, combines each document from the first index with each document from the second.
The result set is the the cartesian product of documents of both indexes.
This operation is similar to the inner join without the `ON` clause that specifies the join condition.

It's risky to perform cross join on two indexes of large or even medium size. It might trigger a circuit breaker that terminates the query to avoid running out of memory.
{: .warning }

SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  a.account_number, a.firstname, a.lastname,
  e.id, e.name
FROM accounts a
JOIN employees_nested e
```

Result set:

| a.account_number | a.firstname | a.lastname | e.id | e.name
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
1 | Amber | Duke | 3 | Bob Smith
1 | Amber | Duke | 4 | Susan Smith

13 | Nanette | Bates | 6 | Jane Smith
18 | Dale | Adams | 3 | Bob Smith
18 | Dale | Adams | 4 | Susan Smith
18 | Dale | Adams | 6 | Jane Smith

##### Example 3: Left outer join

Use left outer join to retain rows from the first index if it does not satisfy the join predicate. The keyword `OUTER` is optional.

SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  a.account_number, a.firstname, a.lastname,
  e.id, e.name
FROM accounts a
LEFT JOIN employees_nested e
 ON a.account_number = e.id
```

Result set:

| a.account_number | a.firstname | a.lastname | e.id | e.name
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
1 | Amber | Duke | null | null
6 | Hattie | Bond | 6 | Jane Smith
13 | Nanette | Bates | null | null
18 | Dale | Adams | null | null

#### Subquery

A subquery is a complete `SELECT` statement used within another statement and enclosed in parenthesis.
From the explain output, you can see that some subqueries are actually transformed to an equivalent join query to execute.

##### Example 1: Table subquery

SQL query:

```sql
SELECT a1.firstname, a1.lastname, a1.balance
FROM accounts a1
WHERE a1.account_number IN (
  SELECT a2.account_number
  FROM accounts a2
  WHERE a2.balance > 10000
)
```

Explain:

```json
{
  "Physical Plan" : {
    "Project [ columns=[a1.balance, a1.firstname, a1.lastname] ]" : {
      "Top [ count=200 ]" : {

### Functions

The SQL language supports all SQL plugin [common functions](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/functions/), including [relevance search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/full-text/), but also introduces a few function synonyms, which are available in SQL only.
These synonyms are provided by the `V1` engine. For more information, see [Limitations](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/limitation).

#### Match query

The `MATCHQUERY` and `MATCH_QUERY` functions are synonyms for the [`MATCH`](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/full-text#match) relevance function. They don't accept additional arguments but provide an alternate syntax.

##### Syntax

To use `matchquery` or `match_query`, pass in your search query and the field name that you want to search against:

```sql
match_query(field_expression, query_expression[, option=<option_value>]*)
matchquery(field_expression, query_expression[, option=<option_value>]*)
field_expression = match_query(query_expression[, option=<option_value>]*)
field_expression = matchquery(query_expression[, option=<option_value>]*)
```

You can specify the following options in any order:

- `analyzer`
- `boost`

##### Example

You can use `MATCHQUERY` to replace `MATCH`:

```sql
SELECT account_number, address
FROM accounts
WHERE MATCHQUERY(address, 'Holmes')
```

Alternatively, you can use `MATCH_QUERY` to replace `MATCH`:

```sql
SELECT account_number, address
FROM accounts
WHERE address = MATCH_QUERY('Holmes')
```

The results contain documents in which the address contains "Holmes":

| account_number | address
:--- | :---
1 | 880 Holmes Lane

#### Multi-match

There are three synonyms for [`MULTI_MATCH`](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/full-text#multi-match), each with a slightly different syntax. They accept a query string and a fields list with weights. They can also accept additional optional parameters.

##### Syntax

```sql
multimatch('query'=query_expression[, 'fields'=field_expression][, option=<option_value>]*)
multi_match('query'=query_expression[, 'fields'=field_expression][, option=<option_value>]*)
multimatchquery('query'=query_expression[, 'fields'=field_expression][, option=<option_value>]*)
```

The `fields` parameter is optional and can contain a single field or a comma-separated list (whitespace characters are not allowed). The weight for each field is optional and is specified after the field name. It should be delimited by the `caret` character -- `^` -- without whitespace. 

##### Example

The following queries show the `fields` parameter of a multi-match query with a single field and a field list: 

```sql
multi_match('fields' = "Tags^2,Title^3.4,Body,Comments^0.3", ...)
multi_match('fields' = "Title", ...)
```

You can specify the following options in any order:

- `analyzer`
- `boost`
- `slop`
- `type`
- `tie_breaker`
- `operator`

#### Query string

The `QUERY` function is a synonym for [`QUERY_STRING`](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/full-text#query-string).

##### Syntax

```sql
query('query'=query_expression[, 'fields'=field_expression][, option=<option_value>]*)
```

The `fields` parameter is optional and can contain a single field or a comma-separated list (whitespace characters are not allowed). The weight for each field is optional and is specified after the field name. It should be delimited by the `caret` character -- `^` -- without whitespace. 

##### Example

The following queries show the `fields` parameter of a multi-match query with a single field and a field list: 

```sql
query('fields' = "Tags^2,Title^3.4,Body,Comments^0.3", ...)
query('fields' = "Tags", ...)
```

You can specify the following options in any order:

- `analyzer`
- `boost`
- `slop`
- `default_field`

##### Example of using `query_string` in SQL and PPL queries:

The following is a sample REST API search request in Enegry Logserver DSL.

```json
GET accounts/_search
{
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "query": "Lane Street",
      "fields": [ "address" ],
    }
  }
}
```

The request above is equivalent to the following `query` function:

```sql
SELECT account_number, address
FROM accounts
WHERE query('address:Lane OR address:Street')
```

The results contain addresses that contain "Lane" or "Street":

| account_number | address
:--- | :---
1 | 880 Holmes Lane
6 | 671 Bristol Street
13 | 789 Madison Street

#### Match phrase

The `MATCHPHRASEQUERY` function is a synonym for [`MATCH_PHRASE`](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/full-text#query-string).

##### Syntax

```sql
matchphrasequery(query_expression, field_expression[, option=<option_value>]*)
```

You can specify the following options in any order:

- `analyzer`
- `boost`
- `slop`

#### Score query

To return a relevance score along with every matching document, use the `SCORE`, `SCOREQUERY`, or `SCORE_QUERY` functions.

##### Syntax

The `SCORE` function expects two arguments. The first argument is the [`MATCH_QUERY`](#match-query) expression. The second argument is an optional floating-point number to boost the score (the default value is 1.0):

```sql
SCORE(match_query_expression, score)
SCOREQUERY(match_query_expression, score)
SCORE_QUERY(match_query_expression, score)
```

##### Example

The following example uses the `SCORE` function to boost the documents' scores:

```sql
SELECT account_number, address, _score
FROM accounts
WHERE SCORE(MATCH_QUERY(address, 'Lane'), 0.5) OR
  SCORE(MATCH_QUERY(address, 'Street'), 100)
ORDER BY _score
```

The results contain matches with corresponding scores:

| account_number | address | score
:--- | :--- | :---
1 | 880 Holmes Lane | 0.5
6 | 671 Bristol Street | 100
13 | 789 Madison Street | 100

#### Wildcard query

To search documents by a given wildcard, use the `WILDCARDQUERY` or `WILDCARD_QUERY` functions.

##### Syntax

```sql
wildcardquery(field_expression, query_expression[, boost=<value>])
wildcard_query(field_expression, query_expression[, boost=<value>])
```

##### Example

The following example uses a wildcard query:

```sql
SELECT account_number, address
FROM accounts
WHERE wildcard_query(address, '*Holmes*');
```

The results contain documents that match the wildcard expression:

| account_number | address
:--- | :---
1 | 880 Holmes Lane



### JSON Support

SQL plugin supports JSON by following [PartiQL](https://partiql.org/) specification, a SQL-compatible query language that lets you query semi-structured and nested data for any data format. The SQL plugin only supports a subset of the PartiQL specification.

#### Querying nested collection

PartiQL extends SQL to allow you to query and unnest nested collections. In Enegry Logserver, this is very useful to query a JSON index with nested objects or fields.

To follow along, use the `bulk` operation to index some sample data:

```json
POST employees_nested/_bulk?refresh
{"index":{"_id":"1"}}
{"id":3,"name":"Bob Smith","title":null,"projects":[{"name":"SQL Spectrum querying","started_year":1990},{"name":"SQL security","started_year":1999},{"name":"Enegry Logserver security","started_year":2015}]}
{"index":{"_id":"2"}}
{"id":4,"name":"Susan Smith","title":"Dev Mgr","projects":[]}
{"index":{"_id":"3"}}
{"id":6,"name":"Jane Smith","title":"Software Eng 2","projects":[{"name":"SQL security","started_year":1998},{"name":"Hello security","started_year":2015,"address":[{"city":"Dallas","state":"TX"}]}]}
```

##### Example 1: Unnesting a nested collection

This example finds the nested document (`projects`) with a field value (`name`) that satisfies the predicate (contains `security`). Because each parent document can have more than one nested documents, the nested document that matches is flattened. In other words, the final result is the cartesian product between the parent and nested documents.

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employeeName,
       p.name AS projectName
FROM employees_nested AS e,
       e.projects AS p
WHERE p.name LIKE '%security%'
```

Explain:

```json
{
  "from" : 0,
  "size" : 200,
  "query" : {
    "bool" : {
      "filter" : [
        {
          "bool" : {
            "must" : [
              {
                "nested" : {
                  "query" : {
                    "wildcard" : {
                      "projects.name" : {
                        "wildcard" : "*security*",
                        "boost" : 1.0
                      }
                    }
                  },
                  "path" : "projects",
                  "ignore_unmapped" : false,
                  "score_mode" : "none",
                  "boost" : 1.0,
                  "inner_hits" : {
                    "ignore_unmapped" : false,
                    "from" : 0,
                    "size" : 3,
                    "version" : false,
                    "seq_no_primary_term" : false,
                    "explain" : false,
                    "track_scores" : false,
                    "_source" : {
                      "includes" : [
                        "projects.name"
                      ],
                      "excludes" : [ ]
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            ],
            "adjust_pure_negative" : true,
            "boost" : 1.0
          }
        }
      ],
      "adjust_pure_negative" : true,
      "boost" : 1.0
    }
  },
  "_source" : {
    "includes" : [
      "name"
    ],
    "excludes" : [ ]
  }
}
```

Result set:

| employeeName | projectName
:--- | :---
Bob Smith | Enegry Logserver Security
Bob Smith | SQL security
Jane Smith | Hello security
Jane Smith | SQL security

##### Example 2: Unnesting in existential subquery

To unnest a nested collection in a subquery to check if it satisfies a condition:

```sql
SELECT e.name AS employeeName
FROM employees_nested AS e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM e.projects AS p
    WHERE p.name LIKE '%security%'
)
```

Explain:

```json
{
  "from" : 0,
  "size" : 200,
  "query" : {
    "bool" : {
      "filter" : [
        {
          "bool" : {
            "must" : [
              {
                "nested" : {
                  "query" : {

### Metadata queries

To see basic metadata about your indexes, use the `SHOW` and `DESCRIBE` commands.

##### Syntax

Rule `showStatement`:

![showStatement](media/media/showStatement.png)

Rule `showFilter`:

![showFilter](media/media/showFilter.png)

##### Example 1: See metadata for indexes

To see metadata for indexes that match a specific pattern, use the `SHOW` command.
Use the wildcard `%` to match all indexes:

```sql
SHOW TABLES LIKE %
```

| TABLE_CAT | TABLE_SCHEM | TABLE_NAME | TABLE_TYPE | REMARKS | TYPE_CAT | TYPE_SCHEM | TYPE_NAME | SELF_REFERENCING_COL_NAME | REF_GENERATION
:--- | :---
docker-cluster | null | accounts | BASE TABLE | null | null | null | null | null | null
docker-cluster  | null | employees_nested | BASE TABLE | null | null | null | null | null | null


##### Example 2: See metadata for a specific index

To see metadata for an index name with a prefix of `acc`:

```sql
SHOW TABLES LIKE acc%
```

| TABLE_CAT | TABLE_SCHEM | TABLE_NAME | TABLE_TYPE | REMARKS | TYPE_CAT | TYPE_SCHEM | TYPE_NAME | SELF_REFERENCING_COL_NAME | REF_GENERATION
:--- | :---
docker-cluster | null | accounts | BASE TABLE | null | null | null | null | null | null


##### Example 3: See metadata for fields

To see metadata for field names that match a specific pattern, use the `DESCRIBE` command:

### Aggregate functions

Aggregate functions operate on subsets defined by the `GROUP BY` clause. In the absence of a `GROUP BY` clause, aggregate functions operate on all elements of the result set. You can use aggregate functions in the `GROUP BY`, `SELECT`, and `HAVING` clauses.

Enegry Logserver supports the following aggregate functions.

Function | Description
:--- | :---
`AVG` | Returns the average of the results.
`COUNT` | Returns the number of results.
`SUM` | Returns the sum of the results.
`MIN` | Returns the minimum of the results.
`MAX` | Returns the maximum of the results.
`VAR_POP` or `VARIANCE` | Returns the population variance of the results after discarding nulls. Returns 0 when there is only one row of results.
`VAR_SAMP` | Returns the sample variance of the results after discarding nulls. Returns null when there is only one row of results.
`STD` or `STDDEV` | Returns the sample standard deviation of the results. Returns 0 when there is only one row of results.
`STDDEV_POP` | Returns the population standard deviation of the results. Returns 0 when there is only one row of results.
`STDDEV_SAMP` | Returns the sample standard deviation of the results. Returns null when there is only one row of results.

The examples below reference an `employees` table. You can try out the examples by indexing the following documents into Enegry Logserver using the bulk index operation:

```json
PUT employees/_bulk?refresh
{"index":{"_id":"1"}}
{"employee_id": 1, "department":1, "firstname":"Amber", "lastname":"Duke", "sales":1356, "sale_date":"2020-01-23"}
{"index":{"_id":"2"}}
{"employee_id": 1, "department":1, "firstname":"Amber", "lastname":"Duke", "sales":39224, "sale_date":"2021-01-06"}
{"index":{"_id":"6"}}
{"employee_id":6, "department":1, "firstname":"Hattie", "lastname":"Bond", "sales":5686, "sale_date":"2021-06-07"}
{"index":{"_id":"7"}}
{"employee_id":6, "department":1, "firstname":"Hattie", "lastname":"Bond", "sales":12432, "sale_date":"2022-05-18"}
{"index":{"_id":"13"}}
{"employee_id":13,"department":2, "firstname":"Nanette", "lastname":"Bates", "sales":32838, "sale_date":"2022-04-11"}
{"index":{"_id":"18"}}
{"employee_id":18,"department":2, "firstname":"Dale", "lastname":"Adams", "sales":4180, "sale_date":"2022-11-05"}
```

#### GROUP BY

The `GROUP BY` clause defines subsets of a result set. Aggregate functions operate on these subsets and return one result row for each subset. 

You can use an identifier, ordinal, or expression in the `GROUP BY` clause.

##### Using an identifier in GROUP BY

You can specify the field name (column name) to aggregate on in the `GROUP BY` clause. For example, the following query returns the department numbers and the total sales for each department: 
```sql
SELECT department, sum(sales) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;
```

| department | sum(sales)
:--- | :---
1 | 58700  |
2 | 37018 |

##### Using an ordinal in GROUP BY

You can specify the column number to aggregate on in the `GROUP BY` clause. The column number is determined by the column position in the `SELECT` clause. For example, the following query is equivalent to the query above. It returns the department numbers and the total sales for each department. It groups the results by the first column of the result set, which is `department`:

```sql
SELECT department, sum(sales) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY 1;
```

| department | sum(sales)
:--- | :---
1 | 58700  |
2 | 37018 |

##### Using an expression in GROUP BY

You can use an expression in the `GROUP BY` clause. For example, the following query returns the average sales for each year:

```sql
SELECT year(sale_date), avg(sales) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY year(sale_date);
```

| year(start_date) | avg(sales)
:--- | :---
| 2020  | 1356.0 |
| 2021 | 22455.0 |
| 2022 | 16484.0  |

#### SELECT

You can use aggregate expressions in the `SELECT` clause either directly or as part of a larger expression. In addition, you can use expressions as arguments of aggregate functions.

##### Using aggregate expressions directly in SELECT

The following query returns the average sales for each department:

```sql
SELECT department, avg(sales) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;
```

| department | avg(sales)
:--- | :---
1 | 14675.0 |
2 | 18509.0 |

##### Using aggregate expressions as part of larger expressions in SELECT

The following query calculates the average commission for the employees of each department as 5% of the average sales:

```sql
SELECT department, avg(sales) * 0.05 as avg_commission 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;
```

| department | avg_commission
:--- | :---
1 | 733.75 |
2 | 925.45 |

##### Using expressions as arguments to aggregate functions

The following query calculates the average commission amount for each department. First it calculates the commission amount for each `sales` value as 5% of the `sales`. Then it determines the average of all commission values:

```sql
SELECT department, avg(sales * 0.05) as avg_commission 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;
```

| department | avg_commission
:--- | :---
1 | 733.75 |
2 | 925.45 |

##### COUNT

The `COUNT` function accepts arguments, such as `*`, or literals, such as `1`.
The following table describes how various forms of the `COUNT` function operate.

| Function type | Description
`COUNT(field)` | Counts the number of rows where the value of the given field (or expression) is not null.
`COUNT(*)` | Counts the total number of rows in a table.
`COUNT(1)` (same as `COUNT(*)`) | Counts any non-null literal.

For example, the following query returns the count of sales for each year:

```sql
SELECT year(sale_date), count(sales) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY year(sale_date);
```

| year(sale_date) | count(sales)
:--- | :---
2020 | 1
2021 | 2
2022 | 3

#### HAVING

Both `WHERE` and `HAVING` are used to filter results. The `WHERE` filter is applied before the `GROUP BY` phase, so you cannot use aggregate functions in a `WHERE` clause. However, you can use the `WHERE` clause to limit the rows to which the aggregate is then applied.

The `HAVING` filter is applied after the `GROUP BY` phase, so you can use the `HAVING` clause to limit the groups that are included in the results. 

##### HAVING with GROUP BY

You can use aggregate expressions or their aliases defined in a `SELECT` clause in a `HAVING` condition.

The following query uses an aggregate expression in the `HAVING` clause. It returns the number of sales for each employee who made more than one sale:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, count(sales)
FROM employees
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING count(sales) > 1;
```

| employee_id | count(sales)
:--- | :---
1 | 2 |
6 | 2

The aggregations in a `HAVING` clause do not have to be the same as the aggregations in a `SELECT` list. The following query uses the `count` function in the `HAVING` clause but the `sum` function in the `SELECT` clause. It returns the total sales amount for each employee who made more than one sale:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, sum(sales)
FROM employees
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING count(sales) > 1;
```

| employee_id | sum (sales)
:--- | :---
1 | 40580 |
6 | 18120

As an extension of the SQL standard, you are not restricted to using only identifiers in the `GROUP BY` clause. The following query uses an alias in the `GROUP BY` clause and is equivalent to the previous query:

```sql
SELECT employee_id as id, sum(sales)
FROM employees
GROUP BY id
HAVING count(sales) > 1;
```

| id | sum (sales)
:--- | :---
1 | 40580 |
6 | 18120

You can also use an alias for an aggregate expression in the `HAVING` clause. The following query returns the total sales for each department where sales exceed $40,000:

```sql
SELECT department, sum(sales) as total
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING total > 40000;
```

| department | total
:--- | :---
1 | 58700 |

If an identifier is ambiguous (for example, present both as a `SELECT` alias and as an index field), the preference is given to the alias. In the following query the identifier is replaced with the expression aliased in the `SELECT` clause:

```sql
SELECT department, sum(sales) as sales
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING sales > 40000;
```

| department | sales
:--- | :---
1 | 58700 |

##### HAVING without GROUP BY

You can use a `HAVING` clause without a `GROUP BY` clause. In this case, the whole set of data is to be considered one group. The following query will return `True` if there is more than one value in the `department` column:

```sql
SELECT 'True' as more_than_one_department FROM employees HAVING min(department) < max(department);
```

| more_than_one_department |
:--- |
True |

If all employees in the employee table belonged to the same department, the result would contain zero rows:

| more_than_one_department
:--- |
 |



### Delete

The `DELETE` statement deletes documents that satisfy the predicates in the `WHERE` clause.
If you don't specify the `WHERE` clause, all documents are deleted.

##### Setting

The `DELETE` statement is disabled by default. To enable the `DELETE` functionality in SQL, you need to update the configuration by sending the following request:

```json
PUT _plugins/_query/settings
{
  "transient": {
    "plugins.sql.delete.enabled": "true"
  }
}
```

##### Syntax

Rule `singleDeleteStatement`:

![singleDeleteStatement](media/media/singleDeleteStatement.png)

##### Example

SQL query:

```sql
DELETE FROM accounts
WHERE age > 30
```

Explain:

```json
{
  "size" : 1000,
  "query" : {
    "bool" : {
      "must" : [
        {
          "range" : {
            "age" : {
              "from" : 30,
              "to" : null,
              "include_lower" : false,
              "include_upper" : true,
              "boost" : 1.0
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "adjust_pure_negative" : true,
      "boost" : 1.0
    }
  },
  "_source" : false
}
```

Result set:

```json
{
  "schema" : [
    {
      "name" : "deleted_rows",
      "type" : "long"
    }
  ],
  "total" : 1,
  "datarows" : [
    [
      3
    ]
  ],
  "size" : 1,
  "status" : 200
}
```

The `datarows` field shows the number of documents deleted.



### PPL &ndash; Piped Processing Language

Piped Processing Language (PPL) is a query language that lets you use pipe (`|`) syntax to explore, discover, and query data stored in Energy Logserver.

To quickly get up and running with PPL, use **Query Workbench** in Energy Logserver Dashboards. To learn more, see [Workbench](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/workbench/).

The PPL syntax consists of commands delimited by the pipe character (`|`) where data flows from left to right through each pipeline.

```sql
search command | command 1 | command 2 ...
```

You can only use read-only commands like `search`, `where`, `fields`, `rename`, `dedup`, `stats`, `sort`, `eval`, `head`, `top`, and `rare`.

#### Quick start

To get started with PPL, choose **Dev Tools** in Energy Logserver Dashboards and use the `bulk` operation to index some sample data:

```json
PUT accounts/_bulk?refresh
{"index":{"_id":"1"}}
{"account_number":1,"balance":39225,"firstname":"Amber","lastname":"Duke","age":32,"gender":"M","address":"880 Holmes Lane","employer":"Pyrami","email":"amberduke@pyrami.com","city":"Brogan","state":"IL"}
{"index":{"_id":"6"}}
{"account_number":6,"balance":5686,"firstname":"Hattie","lastname":"Bond","age":36,"gender":"M","address":"671 Bristol Street","employer":"Netagy","email":"hattiebond@netagy.com","city":"Dante","state":"TN"}
{"index":{"_id":"13"}}
{"account_number":13,"balance":32838,"firstname":"Nanette","lastname":"Bates","age":28,"gender":"F","address":"789 Madison Street","employer":"Quility","city":"Nogal","state":"VA"}
{"index":{"_id":"18"}}
{"account_number":18,"balance":4180,"firstname":"Dale","lastname":"Adams","age":33,"gender":"M","address":"467 Hutchinson Court","email":"daleadams@boink.com","city":"Orick","state":"MD"}
```

Go to **Query Workbench** and select **PPL**.

The following example returns `firstname` and `lastname` fields for documents in an `accounts` index with `age` greater than 18:

```sql
search source=accounts
| where age > 18
| fields firstname, lastname
```

#### Example response

firstname | lastname |
:--- | :--- |
Amber       | Duke
Hattie      | Bond
Nanette     | Bates
Dale        | Adams

![PPL query workbench](media/media/ppl.png)



### PPL syntax

Every PPL query starts with the `search` command. It specifies the index to search and retrieve documents from. Subsequent commands can follow in any order.

Currently, `PPL` supports only one `search` command, which can be omitted to simplify the query.
{ : .note}

#### Syntax

```sql
search source=<index> [boolean-expression]
source=<index> [boolean-expression]
```

Field | Description | Required
:--- | :--- |:---
`search` | Specifies search keywords. | Yes
`index` | Specifies which index to query from. | No
`bool-expression` | Specifies an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value. | No

#### Examples

**Example 1: Search through accounts index**

In the following example, the `search` command refers to an `accounts` index as the source and uses `fields` and `where` commands for the conditions:

```sql
search source=accounts
| where age > 18
| fields firstname, lastname
```

In the following examples, angle brackets `< >` enclose required arguments and square brackets `[ ]` enclose optional arguments.
{: .note }


**Example 2: Get all documents**

To get all documents from the `accounts` index, specify it as the `source`:

```sql
search source=accounts;
```

| account_number | firstname | address | balance | gender | city | employer | state | age | email | lastname |
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| 1  | Amber  | 880 Holmes Lane | 39225 | M | Brogan | Pyrami | IL | 32 | amberduke@pyrami.com  | Duke
| 6  | Hattie | 671 Bristol Street | 5686 | M | Dante | Netagy | TN | 36  | hattiebond@netagy.com | Bond
| 13 | Nanette | 789 Madison Street | 32838 | F | Nogal | Quility | VA | 28 | null | Bates
| 18 | Dale  | 467 Hutchinson Court | 4180 | M | Orick | null | MD | 33 | daleadams@boink.com | Adams

**Example 3: Get documents that match a condition**

To get all documents from the `accounts` index that either have `account_number` equal to 1 or have `gender` as `F`, use the following query:

```sql
search source=accounts account_number=1 or gender=\"F\";
```

| account_number | firstname | address | balance | gender | city | employer | state | age | email | lastname |
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| 1 | Amber | 880 Holmes Lane | 39225 | M | Brogan | Pyrami | IL | 32 | amberduke@pyrami.com | Duke |
| 13 | Nanette | 789 Madison Street | 32838 | F | Nogal | Quility | VA | 28 | null | Bates |



### Commands

`PPL` supports all [`SQL` common](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/functions/) functions, including [relevance search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/full-text/), but also introduces few more functions (called `commands`) which are available in `PPL` only.

#### dedup

The `dedup` (data deduplication) command removes duplicate documents defined by a field from the search result.

#### Syntax

```sql
dedup [int] <field-list> [keepempty=<bool>] [consecutive=<bool>]
```

Field | Description | Type | Required | Default
:--- | :--- |:--- |:--- |:---
`int` |  Retain the specified number of duplicate events for each combination. The number must be greater than 0. If you do not specify a number, only the first occurring event is kept and all other duplicates are removed from the results. | `string` | No | 1
`keepempty` | If true, keep the document if any field in the field list has a null value or a field missing. | `nested list of objects` | No | False
`consecutive` | If true, remove only consecutive events with duplicate combinations of values. | `Boolean` | No | False
`field-list` | Specify a comma-delimited field list. At least one field is required. | `String` or comma-separated list of strings | Yes | -

**Example 1: Dedup by one field**

To remove duplicate documents with the same gender:

```sql
search source=accounts | dedup gender | fields account_number, gender;
```

| account_number | gender
:--- | :--- |
1 | M
13 | F


**Example 2: Keep two duplicate documents**

To keep two duplicate documents with the same gender:

```sql
search source=accounts | dedup 2 gender | fields account_number, gender;
```

| account_number | gender
:--- | :--- |
1 | M
6 | M
13 | F

**Example 3: Keep or ignore an empty field by default**

To keep two duplicate documents with a `null` field value:

```sql
search source=accounts | dedup email keepempty=true | fields account_number, email;
```

| account_number | email
:--- | :--- |
1 | amberduke@pyrami.com
6 | hattiebond@netagy.com
13 | null
18 | daleadams@boink.com

To remove duplicate documents with the `null` field value:

```sql
search source=accounts | dedup email | fields account_number, email;
```

| account_number | email
:--- | :--- |
1 | amberduke@pyrami.com
6 | hattiebond@netagy.com
18 | daleadams@boink.com

**Example 4: Dedup of consecutive documents**

To remove duplicates of consecutive documents:

```sql
search source=accounts | dedup gender consecutive=true | fields account_number, gender;
```

| account_number | gender
:--- | :--- |
1 | M
13 | F
18 | M

#### Limitations

The `dedup` command is not rewritten to Energy Logserver DSL, it is only executed on the coordination node.

#### eval

The `eval` command evaluates an expression and appends its result to the search result.

#### Syntax

```sql
eval <field>=<expression> ["," <field>=<expression> ]...
```

Field | Description | Required
:--- | :--- |:---
`field` | If a field name does not exist, a new field is added. If the field name already exists, it's overwritten. | Yes
`expression` | Specify any supported expression. | Yes

**Example 1: Create a new field**

To create a new `doubleAge` field for each document. `doubleAge` is the result of `age` multiplied by 2:

```sql
search source=accounts | eval doubleAge = age * 2 | fields age, doubleAge;
```

| age | doubleAge
:--- | :--- |
32    | 64
36    | 72
28    | 56
33    | 66

*Example 2*: Overwrite the existing field

To overwrite the `age` field with `age` plus 1:

```sql
search source=accounts | eval age = age + 1 | fields age;
```

| age
:--- |
| 33
| 37
| 29
| 34

**Example 3: Create a new field with a field defined with the `eval` command**

To create a new field `ddAge`. `ddAge` is the result of `doubleAge` multiplied by 2, where `doubleAge` is defined in the `eval` command:

```sql
search source=accounts | eval doubleAge = age * 2, ddAge = doubleAge * 2 | fields age, doubleAge, ddAge;
```

| age | doubleAge | ddAge
:--- | :--- |
| 32    | 64   | 128
| 36    | 72   | 144
| 28    | 56   | 112
| 33    | 66   | 132


#### Limitation

The ``eval`` command is not rewritten to Energy Logserver DSL, it is only executed on the coordination node.

#### fields

Use the `fields` command to keep or remove fields from a search result.

#### Syntax

```sql
fields [+|-] <field-list>
```

Field | Description | Required | Default
:--- | :--- |:---|:---
`index` | Plus (+) keeps only fields specified in the field list. Minus (-) removes all fields specified in the field list. | No | +
`field list` | Specify a comma-delimited list of fields. | Yes | No default

**Example 1: Select specified fields from result**

To get `account_number`, `firstname`, and `lastname` fields from a search result:

```sql
search source=accounts | fields account_number, firstname, lastname;
```

| account_number | firstname  | lastname
:--- | :--- |
| 1   | Amber       | Duke
| 6   | Hattie      | Bond
| 13  | Nanette     | Bates
| 18  | Dale        | Adams

**Example 2: Remove specified fields from a search result**

To remove the `account_number` field from the search results:

```sql
search source=accounts | fields account_number, firstname, lastname | fields - account_number;
```

| firstname | lastname
:--- | :--- |
| Amber   | Duke
| Hattie  | Bond
| Nanette | Bates
| Dale    | Adams


#### parse

Use the `parse` command to parse a text field using regular expression and append the result to the search result. 

#### Syntax

```sql
parse <field> <regular-expression>
```

Field | Description | Required
:--- | :--- |:---
field | A text field. | Yes
regular-expression | The regular expression used to extract new fields from the given test field. If a new field name exists, it will replace the original field. | Yes

The regular expression is used to match the whole text field of each document with Java regex engine. Each named capture group in the expression will become a new ``STRING`` field.

**Example 1: Create new field**

The example shows how to create new field `host` for each document. `host` will be the hostname after `@` in `email` field. Parsing a null field will return an empty string.

```sql
os> source=accounts | parse email '.+@(?<host>.+)' | fields email, host ;
fetched rows / total rows = 4/4
```

| email | host  
:--- | :--- |
| amberduke@pyrami.com  | pyrami.com 
| hattiebond@netagy.com | netagy.com 
| null                  | null          
| daleadams@boink.com   | boink.com  

*Example 2*: Override the existing field

The example shows how to override the existing address field with street number removed.

```sql
os> source=accounts | parse address '\d+ (?<address>.+)' | fields address ;
fetched rows / total rows = 4/4
```

| address
:--- |
| Holmes Lane      
| Bristol Street   
| Madison Street   
| Hutchinson Court

**Example 3: Filter and sort be casted parsed field**

The example shows how to sort street numbers that are higher than 500 in address field.

```sql
os> source=accounts | parse address '(?<streetNumber>\d+) (?<street>.+)' | where cast(streetNumber as int) > 500 | sort num(streetNumber) | fields streetNumber, street ;
fetched rows / total rows = 3/3
```

| streetNumber | street  
:--- | :--- |
| 671 | Bristol Street 
| 789 | Madison Street 
| 880 | Holmes Lane  

#### Limitations

A few limitations exist when using the parse command:

- Fields defined by parse cannot be parsed again. For example, `source=accounts | parse address '\d+ (?<street>.+)' | parse street '\w+ (?<road>\w+)' ;` will fail to return any expressions.
- Fields defined by parse cannot be overridden with other commands. For example, when entering `source=accounts | parse address '\d+ (?<street>.+)' | eval street='1' | where street='1' ;` `where` will not match any documents since `street` cannot be overridden.
- The text field used by parse cannot be overridden. For example, when entering `source=accounts | parse address '\d+ (?<street>.+)' | eval address='1' ;` `street` will not be parse since address is overridden. 
- Fields defined by parse cannot be filtered/sorted after using them in the `stats` command. For example, `source=accounts | parse email '.+@(?<host>.+)' | stats avg(age) by host | where host=pyrami.com ;` `where` will not parse the domain listed.

#### rename

Use the `rename` command to rename one or more fields in the search result.

#### Syntax

```sql
rename <source-field> AS <target-field>["," <source-field> AS <target-field>]...
```

Field | Description | Required
:--- | :--- |:---
`source-field` | The name of the field that you want to rename. | Yes
`target-field` | The name you want to rename to. | Yes

**Example 1: Rename one field**

Rename the `account_number` field as `an`:

```sql
search source=accounts | rename account_number as an | fields an;
```

| an
:--- |
| 1
| 6
| 13
| 18

**Example 2: Rename multiple fields**

Rename the `account_number` field as `an` and `employer` as `emp`:

```sql
search source=accounts | rename account_number as an, employer as emp | fields an, emp;
```

| an   | emp
:--- | :--- |
| 1    | Pyrami
| 6    | Netagy
| 13   | Quility
| 18   | null

#### Limitations

The `rename` command is not rewritten to Energy Logserver DSL, it is only executed on the coordination node.

#### sort

Use the `sort` command to sort search results by a specified field.

#### Syntax

```sql
sort [count] <[+|-] sort-field>...
```

Field | Description | Required | Default
:--- | :--- |:---
`count` | The maximum number results to return from the sorted result. If count=0, all results are returned. | No | 1000
`[+|-]` | Use plus [+] to sort by ascending order and minus [-] to sort by descending order. | No | Ascending order
`sort-field` | Specify the field that you want to sort by. | Yes | -

**Example 1: Sort by one field**

To sort all documents by the `age` field in ascending order:

```sql
search source=accounts | sort age | fields account_number, age;
```

| account_number | age |
:--- | :--- |
| 13 | 28
| 1  | 32
| 18 | 33
| 6  | 36

**Example 2: Sort by one field and return all results**

To sort all documents by the `age` field in ascending order and specify count as 0 to get back all results:

```sql
search source=accounts | sort 0 age | fields account_number, age;
```

| account_number | age |
:--- | :--- |
| 13 | 28
| 1  | 32
| 18 | 33
| 6  | 36

**Example 3: Sort by one field in descending order**

To sort all documents by the `age` field in descending order:

```sql
search source=accounts | sort - age | fields account_number, age;
```

| account_number | age |
:--- | :--- |
| 6 | 36
| 18  | 33
| 1 | 32
| 13  | 28

**Example 4: Specify the number of sorted documents to return**

To sort all documents by the `age` field in ascending order and specify count as 2 to get back two results:

```sql
search source=accounts | sort 2 age | fields account_number, age;
```

| account_number | age |
:--- | :--- |
| 13 | 28
| 1  | 32

**Example 5: Sort by multiple fields**

To sort all documents by the `gender` field in ascending order and `age` field in descending order:

```sql
search source=accounts | sort + gender, - age | fields account_number, gender, age;
```

| account_number | gender | age |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
| 13 | F | 28
| 6  | M | 36
| 18 | M | 33
| 1  | M | 32

#### stats

Use the `stats` command to aggregate from search results.

The following table lists the aggregation functions and also indicates how each one handles null or missing values:

Function | NULL | MISSING
:--- | :--- |:---
`COUNT` | Not counted | Not counted
`SUM` | Ignore | Ignore
`AVG` | Ignore | Ignore
`MAX` | Ignore | Ignore
`MIN` | Ignore | Ignore


#### Syntax

```
stats <aggregation>... [by-clause]...
```

Field | Description | Required | Default
:--- | :--- |:---
`aggregation` | Specify a statistical aggregation function. The argument of this function must be a field. | Yes | 1000
`by-clause` | Specify one or more fields to group the results by. If not specified, the `stats` command returns only one row, which is the aggregation over the entire result set. | No | -

**Example 1: Calculate the average value of a field**

To calculate the average `age` of all documents:

```sql
search source=accounts | stats avg(age);
```

| avg(age)
:--- |
| 32.25

**Example 2: Calculate the average value of a field by group**

To calculate the average age grouped by gender:

```sql
search source=accounts | stats avg(age) by gender;
```

| gender | avg(age)
:--- | :--- |
| F  | 28.0
| M  | 33.666666666666664

**Example 3: Calculate the average and sum of a field by group**

To calculate the average and sum of age grouped by gender:

```sql
search source=accounts | stats avg(age), sum(age) by gender;
```

| gender | avg(age) | sum(age)
:--- | :--- |
| F  | 28   | 28
| M  | 33.666666666666664 | 101

**Example 4: Calculate the maximum value of a field**

To calculate the maximum age:

```sql
search source=accounts | stats max(age);
```

| max(age)
:--- |
| 36

**Example 5: Calculate the maximum and minimum value of a field by group**

To calculate the maximum and minimum age values grouped by gender:

```sql
search source=accounts | stats max(age), min(age) by gender;
```

| gender | min(age) | max(age)
:--- | :--- | :--- |
| F  | 28 | 28
| M  | 32 | 36

#### where

Use the `where` command with a bool expression to filter the search result. The `where` command only returns the result when the bool expression evaluates to true.

#### Syntax

```sql
where <boolean-expression>
```

Field | Description | Required
:--- | :--- |:---
`bool-expression` | An expression that evaluates to a boolean value. | No

**Example: Filter result set with a condition**

To get all documents from the `accounts` index where `account_number` is 1 or gender is `F`:

```sql
search source=accounts | where account_number=1 or gender=\"F\" | fields account_number, gender;
```

| account_number | gender
:--- | :--- |
| 1  | M
| 13 | F

#### head

Use the `head` command to return the first N number of results in a specified search order.

#### Syntax

```sql
head [N]
```

Field | Description | Required | Default
:--- | :--- |:---

### Identifiers

An identifier is an ID to name your database objects, such as index names, field names, aliases, and so on.
Enegry Logserver supports two types of identifiers: regular identifiers and delimited identifiers.

#### Regular identifiers

A regular identifier is a string of characters that starts with an ASCII letter (lower or upper case).
The next character can either be a letter, digit, or underscore (_). It can't be a reserved keyword.
Whitespace and other special characters are also not allowed.

Enegry Logserver supports the following regular identifiers:

1. Identifiers prefixed by a dot `.` sign. Use to hide an index. For example `.opensearch-dashboards`.
2. Identifiers prefixed by an `@` sign. Use for meta fields generated by Logstash ingestion.
3. Identifiers with hyphen `-` in the middle. Use for index names with date information.
4. Identifiers with star `*` present. Use for wildcard match of index patterns.

For regular identifiers, you can use the name without any back tick or escape characters.
In this example, `source`, `fields`, `account_number`, `firstname`, and `lastname` are all identifiers. Out of these, the `source` field is a reserved identifier.

```sql
SELECT account_number, firstname, lastname FROM accounts;
```

| account_number | firstname | lastname |
:--- | :--- |
| 1  | Amber | Duke       
| 6  | Hattie | Bond
| 13 | Nanette | Bates
| 18 | Dale | Adams


#### Delimited identifiers

A delimited identifier can contain special characters not allowed by a regular identifier.
You must enclose delimited identifiers with back ticks (\`\`). Back ticks differentiate the identifier from special characters.

If the index name includes a dot (`.`), for example, `log-2021.01.11`, use delimited identifiers with back ticks to escape it \``log-2021.01.11`\`.

Typical examples of using delimited identifiers:

1. Identifiers with reserved keywords.
2. Identifiers with a `.` present. Similarly, `-` to include date information.
3. Identifiers with other special characters. For example, Unicode characters.

To quote an index name with back ticks:

```sql
source=`accounts` | fields `account_number`;
```

| account_number |
:--- |
| 1  |       
| 6  |
| 13 |
| 18 |

#### Case sensitivity

Identifiers are case sensitive. They must be exactly the same as what's stored in Enegry Logserver.

For example, if you run `source=Accounts`, you'll get an index not found exception because the actual index name is in lower case.



### Data types

The following table shows the data types supported by the SQL plugin and how each one maps to SQL and Enegry Logserver data types:

| Enegry Logserver SQL Type | Enegry Logserver Type | SQL Type
:--- | :--- | :---
boolean |	boolean |	BOOLEAN
byte |	byte |	TINYINT
short |	byte |	SMALLINT
integer |	integer |	INTEGER
long | long |	BIGINT
float |	float |	REAL
half_float | float | FLOAT
scaled_float | float | DOUBLE
double | double | DOUBLE
keyword |	string | VARCHAR
text | text | VARCHAR
date | timestamp | TIMESTAMP
date_nanos | timestamp | TIMESTAMP
ip | ip | VARCHAR
date | timestamp | TIMESTAMP
binary | binary | VARBINARY
object | struct | STRUCT
nested | array | STRUCT

In addition to this list, the SQL plugin also supports the `datetime` type, though it doesn't have a corresponding mapping with Enegry Logserver or SQL.
To use a function without a corresponding mapping, you must explicitly convert the data type to one that does.


#### Date and time types

The date and time types represent a time period: `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `INTERVAL`. By default, the Enegry Logserver DSL uses the `date` type as the only date-time related type that contains all information of an absolute time point.

To integrate with SQL, each type other than the `timestamp` type holds part of the time period information. To use date-time functions, see [datetime](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/functions#date-and-time). Some functions might have restrictions for the input argument type.


#### Date

The `date` type represents the calendar date regardless of the time zone. A given date value is a 24-hour period, but this period varies in different timezones and might have flexible hours during daylight saving programs. The `date` type doesn't contain time information and it only supports a range of `1000-01-01` to `9999-12-31`.

| Type | Syntax | Range
:--- | :--- | :---
date | `yyyy-MM-dd` | `0001-01-01` to `9999-12-31`

#### Time

The `time` type represents the time of a clock regardless of its timezone. The `time` type doesn't contain date information.

| Type | Syntax | Range
:--- | :--- | :---
time | `hh:mm:ss[.fraction]` | `00:00:00.0000000000` to `23:59:59.9999999999`

#### Datetime

The `datetime` type is a combination of date and time. It doesn't contain timezone information. For an absolute time point that contains date, time, and timezone information, see [Timestamp](#timestamp).

| Type | Syntax | Range
:--- | :--- | :---
datetime | `yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss[.fraction]` | `0001-01-01 00:00:00.0000000000` to `9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999999`

#### Timestamp

The `timestamp` type is an absolute instance independent of timezone or convention. For example, for a given point of time, if you change the timestamp to a different timezone, its value changes accordingly.

The `timestamp` type is stored differently from the other types. It's converted from its current timezone to UTC for storage and converted back to its set timezone from UTC when it's retrieved.

| Type | Syntax | Range
:--- | :--- | :---
timestamp | `yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss[.fraction]` | `0001-01-01 00:00:01.9999999999` UTC to `9999-12-31 23:59:59.9999999999`

#### Interval

The `interval` type represents a temporal duration or a period.

| Type | Syntax
:--- | :---
interval | `INTERVAL expr unit`

The `expr` unit is any expression that eventually iterates to a quantity value. It represents a unit for interpreting the quantity, including `MICROSECOND`, `SECOND`, `MINUTE`, `HOUR`, `DAY`, `WEEK`, `MONTH`, `QUARTER`, and `YEAR`. The `INTERVAL` keyword and the unit specifier are not case sensitive.

The `interval` type has two classes of intervals: year-week intervals and day-time intervals.

- Year-week intervals store years, quarters, months, and weeks.
- Day-time intervals store days, hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds.


#### Convert between date and time types

Apart from the `interval` type, all date and time types can be converted to each other. The conversion might alter the value or cause some information loss. For example, when extracting the `time` value from a `datetime` value, or converting a `date` value to a `datetime` value, and so on.

The SQL plugin supports the following conversion rules for each of the types:

**Convert from date**

- Because the `date` value doesn't have any time information, conversion to the `time` type isn't useful and always returns a zero time value of `00:00:00`.
- Converting from `date` to `datetime` has a data fill-up due to the lack of time information. It attaches the time `00:00:00` to the original date by default and forms a `datetime` instance. For example, conversion of `2020-08-17` to a `datetime` type is `2020-08-17 00:00:00`.
- Converting to `timestamp` type alternates both the `time` value and the `timezone` information. It attaches the zero time value `00:00:00` and the session timezone (UTC by default) to the date. For example, conversion of `2020-08-17` to a `datetime` type with a session timezone UTC is `2020-08-17 00:00:00 UTC`.

**Convert from time**

- You cannot convert the `time` type to any other date and time types because it doesn't contain any date information.

**Convert from datetime**

- Converting `datetime` to `date` extracts the date value from the `datetime` value. For example, conversion of `2020-08-17 14:09:00` to a `date` type is `2020-08-08`.
- Converting `datetime` to `time` extracts the time value from the `datetime` value. For example, conversion of `2020-08-17 14:09:00` to a `time` type is `14:09:00`.
- Because the `datetime` type doesn't contain timezone information, converting to `timestamp` type fills up the timezone value with the session timezone. For example, conversion of `2020-08-17 14:09:00` (UTC) to a `timestamp` type is `2020-08-17 14:09:00 UTC`.

**Convert from timestamp**

- Converting from a `timestamp` type to a `date` type extracts the date value and converting to a `time` type extracts the time value. Converting from a `timestamp` type to `datetime` type extracts only the `datetime` value and leaves out the timezone value. For example, conversion of `2020-08-17 14:09:00` UTC to a `date` type is `2020-08-17`, to a `time` type is `14:09:00`, and to a `datetime` type is `2020-08-17 14:09:00`.



### Functions

You must enable fielddata in the document mapping for most string functions to work properly.

The specification shows the return type of the function with a generic type `T` as the argument.
For example, `abs(number T) -> T` means that the function `abs` accepts a numerical argument of type `T`, which could be any subtype of the `number` type, and it returns the actual type of `T` as the return type.

The SQL plugin supports the following common functions shared across the SQL and PPL languages.

#### Relevance-based search (full-text search)

These functions are only available in the `WHERE` clause. For their descriptions and usage examples in SQL and PPL, see [Full-text search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/full-text/).



### Full-text search

Use SQL commands for full-text search. The SQL plugin supports a subset of full-text queries available in Enegry Logserver.

To learn about full-text queries in Enegry Logserver, see [Full-text queries](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/query-dsl/full-text/index).

#### Match

Use the `MATCH` function to search documents that match a `string`, `number`, `date`, or `boolean` value for a given field.

#### Syntax

```sql
match(field_expression, query_expression[, option=<option_value>]*)
```

You can specify the following options in any order:

- `analyzer`
- `auto_generate_synonyms_phrase`
- `fuzziness`
- `max_expansions`
- `prefix_length`
- `fuzzy_transpositions`
- `fuzzy_rewrite`
- `lenient`
- `operator`
- `minimum_should_match`
- `zero_terms_query`
- `boost`

Refer to the `match` query [documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/query-dsl/full-text/index#match) for parameter descriptions and supported values.

#### Example 1: Search the `message` field for the text "this is a test":

```json
GET my_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "message": "this is a test"
    }
  }
}
```

*SQL query:*
```sql
SELECT message FROM my_index WHERE match(message, "this is a test")
```
*PPL query:*
```ppl
SOURCE=my_index | WHERE match(message, "this is a test") | FIELDS message
```

#### Example 2: Search the `message` field with the `operator` parameter:

```json
GET my_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "message": {
        "query": "this is a test",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*SQL query:*
```sql
SELECT message FROM my_index WHERE match(message, "this is a test", operator='and')
```
*PPL query:*
```ppl
SOURCE=my_index | WHERE match(message, "this is a test", operator='and') | FIELDS message
```

#### Example 3: Search the `message` field with the `operator` and `zero_terms_query` parameters:

```json
GET my_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "message": {
        "query": "to be or not to be",
        "operator": "and",
        "zero_terms_query": "all"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*SQL query:*
```sql
SELECT message FROM my_index WHERE match(message, "this is a test", operator='and', zero_terms_query='all')
```
*PPL query:*
```sql
SOURCE=my_index | WHERE match(message, "this is a test", operator='and', zero_terms_query='all') | FIELDS message
```

#### Multi-match

To search for text in multiple fields, use `MULTI_MATCH` function. This function maps to the `multi_match` query used in search engine, to returns the documents that match a provided text, number, date or boolean value with a given field or fields.

#### Syntax

The `MULTI_MATCH` function lets you *boost* certain fields using **^** character. Boosts are multipliers that weigh matches in one field more heavily than matches in other fields. The syntax allows to specify the fields in double quotes, single quotes,  surrounded by backticks, or unquoted. Use star ``"*"`` to search all fields. Star symbol should be quoted.

```sql
multi_match([field_expression+], query_expression[, option=<option_value>]*)
```

The weight is optional and is specified after the field name. It could be delimited by the `caret` character -- `^` or by whitespace. Please, refer to examples below:

```sql
multi_match(["Tags" ^ 2, 'Title' 3.4, `Body`, Comments ^ 0.3], ...)
multi_match(["*"], ...)
```

You can specify the following options for `MULTI_MATCH` in any order:

- `analyzer`
- `auto_generate_synonyms_phrase`
- `cutoff_frequency`
- `fuzziness`
- `fuzzy_transpositions`
- `lenient`
- `max_expansions`
- `minimum_should_match`
- `operator`
- `prefix_length`
- `tie_breaker`
- `type`
- `slop`
- `zero_terms_query`
- `boost`

Please, refer to `multi_match` query [documentation](#multi-match) for parameter description and supported values.

#### For example, REST API search for `Dale` in either the `firstname` or `lastname` fields:

```json
GET accounts/_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "Lane Street",
      "fields": [ "address" ],
    }
  }
}
```
could be called from *SQL* using `multi_match` function
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname
FROM accounts
WHERE multi_match(['*name'], 'Dale')
```
or `multi_match` *PPL* function
```sql
SOURCE=accounts | WHERE multi_match(['*name'], 'Dale') | fields firstname, lastname
```

| firstname | lastname
:--- | :---
Dale | Adams

#### Query string

To split text based on operators, use the `QUERY_STRING` function. The `QUERY_STRING` function supports logical connectives, wildcard, regex, and proximity search.
This function maps to the to the `query_string` query used in search engine, to return the documents that match a provided text, number, date or boolean value with a given field or fields.

#### Syntax

The `QUERY_STRING` function has syntax similar to `MATCH_QUERY` and lets you *boost* certain fields using **^** character. Boosts are multipliers that weigh matches in one field more heavily than matches in other fields. The syntax allows to specify the fields in double quotes, single quotes,  surrounded by backticks, or unquoted. Use star ``"*"`` to search all fields. Star symbol should be quoted.

```sql
query_string([field_expression+], query_expression[, option=<option_value>]*)
```

The weight is optional and is specified after the field name. It could be delimited by the `caret` character -- `^` or by whitespace. Please, refer to examples below:

```sql
query_string(["Tags" ^ 2, 'Title' 3.4, `Body`, Comments ^ 0.3], ...)
query_string(["*"], ...)
```

You can specify the following options for `QUERY_STRING` in any order:

- `analyzer`
- `allow_leading_wildcard`
- `analyze_wildcard`
- `auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query`
- `boost`
- `default_operator`
- `enable_position_increments`
- `fuzziness`
- `fuzzy_rewrite`
- `escape`
- `fuzzy_max_expansions`
- `fuzzy_prefix_length`
- `fuzzy_transpositions`
- `lenient`
- `max_determinized_states`
- `minimum_should_match`
- `quote_analyzer`
- `phrase_slop`
- `quote_field_suffix`
- `rewrite`
- `type`
- `tie_breaker`
- `time_zone`

Refer to the `query_string` query [documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/query-dsl/full-text/index#query-string) for parameter descriptions and supported values.

#### Example of using `query_string` in SQL and PPL queries:

The REST API search request

```json
GET accounts/_search
{
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "query": "Lane Street",
      "fields": [ "address" ],
    }
  }
}
```

could be called from *SQL*

```sql
SELECT account_number, address
FROM accounts
WHERE query_string(['address'], 'Lane Street', default_operator='OR')
```

or from *PPL*

```sql
SOURCE=accounts | WHERE query_string(['address'], 'Lane Street', default_operator='OR') | fields account_number, address
```

| account_number | address
:--- | :---
1 | 880 Holmes Lane
6 | 671 Bristol Street
13 | 789 Madison Street

#### Match phrase

To search for exact phrases, use `MATCHPHRASE` or `MATCH_PHRASE` functions.

#### Syntax

```sql
matchphrasequery(field_expression, query_expression)
matchphrase(field_expression, query_expression[, option=<option_value>]*)
match_phrase(field_expression, query_expression[, option=<option_value>]*)
```

The `MATCHPHRASE`/`MATCH_PHRASE` functions let you specify the following options in any order:

- `analyzer`
- `slop`
- `zero_terms_query`
- `boost`

Refer to the `match_phrase` query [documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/query-dsl/full-text/index#match-phrase) for parameter descriptions and supported values.

#### Example of using `match_phrase` in SQL and PPL queries:

The REST API search request
```json
GET accounts/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "address": {
        "query": "880 Holmes Lane"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
could be called from *SQL*
```sql
SELECT account_number, address
FROM accounts
WHERE match_phrase(address, '880 Holmes Lane')
```
or *PPL*
```sql
SOURCE=accounts | WHERE match_phrase(address, '880 Holmes Lane') | FIELDS account_number, address
```

| account_number | address
:--- | :---
1 | 880 Holmes Lane


#### Simple query string

The `simple_query_string` function maps to the `simple_query_string` query in Enegry Logserver. It returns the documents that match a provided text, number, date or boolean value with a given field or fields.
The **^** lets you *boost* certain fields. Boosts are multipliers that weigh matches in one field more heavily than matches in other fields.

#### Syntax

The syntax allows to specify the fields in double quotes, single quotes,  surrounded by backticks, or unquoted. Use star ``"*"`` to search all fields. Star symbol should be quoted.

```sql
simple_query_string([field_expression+], query_expression[, option=<option_value>]*)
```

The weight is optional and is specified after the field name. It could be delimited by the `caret` character -- `^` or by whitespace. Please, refer to examples below:

```sql
simple_query_string(["Tags" ^ 2, 'Title' 3.4, `Body`, Comments ^ 0.3], ...)
simple_query_string(["*"], ...)
```

You can specify the following options for `SIMPLE_QUERY_STRING` in any order:

- `analyze_wildcard`
- `analyzer`
- `auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query`
- `boost`
- `default_operator`
- `flags`
- `fuzzy_max_expansions`
- `fuzzy_prefix_length`
- `fuzzy_transpositions`
- `lenient`

## Automation

Automations helps you to interconnect different apps with an API with each other to share and manipulate its data without a single line of code. It is an easy to use, user-friendly and highly customizable module, which uses an intuitive user interface for you to design your unique scenarios very fast.
A automation is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process.
A automation can be started manually (with the Start node) or by Trigger nodes (e.g. Webhook). When a automation is started, it executes all the active and connected nodes. The automation execution ends when all the nodes have processed their data. You can view your automation executions in the Execution log, which can be helpful for debugging.

![](/media/media/execute_workflow.gif)

**Activating a automation**
Automations that start with a Trigger node or a Webhook node need to be activated in order to be executed. This is done via the Active toggle in the Automation UI.
Active automations enable the Trigger and Webhook nodes to receive data whenever a condition is met (e.g., Monday at 10:00, an update in a Trello board) and in turn trigger the automation execution.
All the newly created automations are deactivated by default.

**Sharing a automation**

Automations are saved in JSON format. You can export your automations as JSON files or import JSON files into your system.
You can export a automation as a JSON file in two ways:

- Download: Click the Download button under the Automation menu in the sidebar. This will download the automation as a JSON file.
- Copy-Paste: Select all the automation nodes in the Automation UI, copy them (Ctrl + c), then paste them (Ctrl + v) in your desired file.
You can import JSON files as automations in two ways:
- Import: Click Import from File or Import from URL under the Automation menu in the sidebar and select the JSON file or paste the link to a automation.
- Copy-Paste: Copy the JSON automation to the clipboard (Ctrl + c) and paste it (Ctrl + v) into the Automation UI.

**Automation settings**

On each automation, it is possible to set some custom settings and overwrite some of the global default settings from the Automation > Settings menu.

![](/media/media/workflow-settings.png)

The following settings are available:

- Error Automation: Select an automation to trigger if the current automation fails.
- Timezone: Sets the timezone to be used in the automation. The Timezone setting is particularly important for the Cron Trigger node.
- Save Data Error Execution: If the execution data of the automation should be saved when the automation fails.
- Save Data Success Execution: If the execution data of the automation should be saved when the automation succeeds.
- Save Manual Executions: If executions started from the Automation UI should be saved.
- Save Execution Progress: If the execution data of each node should be saved. If set to "Yes", the automation resumes from where it stopped in case of an error. However, this might increase latency.
- Timeout Automation: Toggle to enable setting a duration after which the current automation execution should be cancelled.
- Timeout After: Only available when Timeout Automation is enabled. Set the time in hours, minutes, and seconds after which the automation should timeout.

**Failed automations**

If your automation execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed automation:

1. Open the Executions list from the sidebar.
2. For the automation execution you want to retry, click on the refresh icon under the Status column.
3. Select either of the following options to retry the execution:

  - Retry with currently saved automation: Once you make changes to your automation, you can select this option to execute the automation with the previous execution data.
  - Retry with original automation: If you want to retry the execution without making changes to your automation, you can select this option to retry the execution with the previous execution data.

You can also use the Error Trigger node, which triggers a automation when another automation has an error. Once a automation fails, this node gets details about the failed automation and the errors.

### Connection

A connection establishes a link between nodes to route data through the automation. A connection between two nodes passes data from one node's output to another node's input. Each node can have one or multiple connections.

To create a connection between two nodes, click on the grey dot on the right side of the node and slide the arrow to the grey rectangle on the left side of the following node.

#### Example

An IF node has two connections to different nodes: one for when the statement is true and one for when the statement is false.

![](/media/media/Connection_ifnode.8e006dce.gif)

### Automations List

This section includes the operations for creating and editing automations.

- **New**: Create a new automation
- **Open**: Open the list of saved automations
- **Save**: Save changes to the current automation
- **Save As**: Save the current automation under a new name
- **Rename**: Rename the current automation
- **Delete**: Delete the current automation
- **Download**: Download the current automation as a JSON file
- **Import from URL**: Import a automation from a URL
- **Import from File**: Import a automation from a local file
- **Settings**: View and change the settings of the current automation

### Credentials

This section includes the operations for creating credentials.

Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps/services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app/service and the n8n node.

- **New**: Create new credentials
- **Open**: Open the list of saved credentials

### Executions

This section includes information about your automation executions, each completed run of a automation.

You can enabling logging of your failed, successful, and/or manually selected automations using the Automation > Settings page.

### Node

A node is an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process performed by nodes can include filtering, recomposing, and changing data.

There may be one or several nodes for your API, service, or app. By connecting multiple nodes, you can create simple and complex automations. When you add a node to the Editor UI, the node is automatically activated and requires you to configure it (by adding credentials, selecting operations, writing expressions, etc.).

There are three types of nodes:

- Core Nodes
- Regular Nodes
- Trigger Nodes

#### Core nodes

Core nodes are functions or services that can be used to control how automations are run or to provide generic API support.

Use the Start node when you want to manually trigger the automation with the `Execute Automation` button at the bottom of the Editor UI. This way of starting the automation is useful when creating and testing new automations.

If an application you need does not have a dedicated Node yet, you can access the data by using the HTTP Request node or the Webhook node. You can also read about creating nodes and make a node for your desired application.

#### Regular nodes

Regular nodes perform an action, like fetching data or creating an entry in a calendar. Regular nodes are named for the application they represent and are listed under Regular Nodes in the Editor UI.

![](/media/media/Regular_nodes.d3cec3e9.png)

#### Example

A Google Sheets node can be used to retrieve or write data to a Google Sheet.

![](/media/media/Google_sheets.d9ee72a3.png)

#### Trigger nodes

Trigger nodes start automations and supply the initial data.

![](/media/media/Trigger_nodes.5bd536aa.png)

Trigger nodes can be app or core nodes.

- **Core Trigger nodes** start the automation at a specific time, at a time interval, or on a webhook call. For example, to get all users from a Postgres database every 10 minutes, use the Interval Trigger node with the Postgres node.

- **App Trigger nodes** start the automation when an event happens in an app. App Trigger nodes are named like the application they represent followed by "Trigger" and are listed under Trigger Nodes in the Editor. For example, a Telegram trigger node can be used to trigger a automation when a message is sent in a Telegram chat.

![](/media/media/telegram_trigger.fae8dcd9.png)

#### Node settings

Nodes come with global **operations** and **settings**, as well as app-specific **parameters** that can be configured.

#### Operations

The node operations are illustrated with icons that appear on top of the node when you hover on it:

- **Delete**: Remove the selected node from the automation
- **Pause**: Deactivate the selected node
- **Copy**: Duplicate the selected node
- **Play**: Run the selected node

![](/media/media/Node_settings.36ddf764.gif)

To access the node parameters and settings, double-click on the node.

#### Parameters

The node parameters allow you to define the operations the node should perform. Find the available parameters of each node in the node reference.

#### Settings

The node settings allow you to configure the look and execution of the node. The following options are available:

- **Notes**: Optional note to save with the node
- **Display note in flow**: If active, the note above will be displayed in the automation as a subtitle
- **Node Color**: The color of the node in the automation
- **Always Output Data**: If active, the node will return an empty item even if the node returns no data during an initial execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.
- **Execute Once**: If active, the node executes only once, with data from the first item it receives.
- **Retry On Fail**: If active, the node tries to execute a failed attempt multiple times until it succeeds
- **Continue On Fail**: If active, the automation continues even if the execution of the node fails. When this happens, the node passes along input data from previous nodes, so the automation should account for unexpected output data.

![](/media/media/Node_parameters.090b2d35.gif)

If a node is not correctly configured or is missing some required information, a **warning sign** is displayed on the top right corner of the node. To see what parameters are incorrect, double-click on the node and have a look at fields marked with red and the error message displayed in the respective warning symbol.

![](/media/media/Node_error.e189f05d.gif)

### How to filter events

You can do it in multiple ways. You can use those nodes:

- IF
- Switch
- Spreadsheet File (a lot of conditions - advanced)

#### Example If usage

If you receive messages from Logstash then you have fields like host.name. You can use if condition to filter known host.

1. Create If node
2. Click Add condition
3. From dropdown menu select String
4. As Value 1 type or select a field which you want use. In this example we use expression `{{ $json["host"]["name"] }}`
5. As Value 2 type host name which you want to process. In this example we use paloalto.paseries.test
6. Next you can select any other node for further process filtered message.

#### Example Case usage

1. Create Case node
2. Select Rules on Mode
3. Select String on Data Type
4. As Value 1 type or select a field which you want use. In this example we use expression `{{ $json["host"]["name"] }}`
5. Click Add Routing Rule
6. As Value 2 type host name which you want to process. In this example, we use paloalto.paseries.test
7. As Output type 0.

You can add multiple conditions. On one node you can add 3 conditions if you need more then add to latest output next node and select this node as Fallback Output.

#### IF

The IF node is used to split a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.

#### Node Reference

You can add comparison conditions using the Add Condition dropdown. Conditions can be created based on the data type, the available comparison operations vary for each data type.

Boolean

- Equal
- Not Equal
- Number

Smaller

- Smaller Equal
- Equal
- Not Equal
- Larger
- Larger Equal
- Is Empty

String

- Contains
- Equal
- Not Contains
- Not Equal
- Regex
- Is Empty

You can choose to split a workflow when any of the specified conditions are met, or only when all the specified conditions are met using the options in the Combine dropdown list.

#### Switch

The Switch node is used to route a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations. It is similar to the IF node, but supports up to four conditional routes.

#### Node Reference

Mode: This dropdown is used to select whether the conditions will be defined as rules in the node, or as an expression, programmatically.

You can add comparison conditions using the Add Routing Rule dropdown. Conditions can be created based on the data type. The available comparison operations vary for each data type.

Boolean

- Equal
- Not Equal

Number

- Smaller
- Smaller Equal
- Equal
- Not Equal
- Larger
- Larger Equal

String

- Contains
- Equal
- Not Contains
- Not Equal
- Regex

You can route a workflow when none of the specified conditions are met using Fallback Output dropdown list.

#### Spreadsheet File

The Spreadsheet File node is used to access data from spreadsheet files.

#### Basic Operations

- Read from file
- Write to file

#### Node Reference

When writing to a spreadsheet file, the File Format field can be used to specify the format of the file to save the data as.

File Format

- CSV (Comma-separated values)
- HTML (HTML Table)
- ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet)
- RTF (Rich Text Format)
- XLS (Excel)
- XLSX (Excel)

Binary Property field: Name of the binary property in which to save the binary data of the spreadsheet file.

Options

- Sheet Name field: This field specifies the name of the sheet from which the data should be read or written to.
- Read As String field: This toggle enables you to parse all input data as strings.
- RAW Data field: This toggle enables you to skip the parsing of data.
- File Name field: This field can be used to specify a custom file name when writing a spreadsheet file to disk.

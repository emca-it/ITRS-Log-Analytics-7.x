# SIEM Plan

SIEM Plan provides access to a database of hundreds of predefined correlation rules and sets of ready-made visualizations and dashboards that give a quick overview of the organizations security status. At the same time, the system still provides a great flexibility in building your own correlation rules and visualizations exactly as required by your organization.

System responds to the needs of today’s organizations by allowing identification of threats on the basis of a much larger amount of data, not always related to the security area as it is provided by traditional SIEM systems.

Product contains deep expert knowledge about security posture. Using entire ecosystem of correlation rules, security dashboards with ability to create electronic documentation SIEM PLAN allows You to score the readiness of Your organization to prevent cyber-attacks. Embedded integration with MITRE ATT&CK quickly identifies unmanaged areas where Your organization potentially needs improvements. Security design will be measured and scored . Single screen will show You potential risk and the consequences of an attack hitting any area of the organization.

Use SIEM Plan do prevent loss of reputation, data leakage, phishing or any other cyber-attack and stay safe.

## Alert Module

### Enabling the Alert Module

### SMTP server configuration

To configuring STMP server for email notification you should:

- edit `/opt/alert/config.yml` and add the following section:

  ```bash
  # email conf
  smtp_host: "mail.example.conf"
  smtp_port: 587
  smtp_ssl: false
  from_addr: "siem@example.com"
  smtp_auth_file: "/opt/alert/smtp_auth_file.yml"
  ```

- add the new `/opt/alert/smtp_auth_file.yml` file:

  ```bash
  user: "user"
  password: "password"
  ```

- restart `alert` service:

  ```bash
  systemctl restat alert
  ```


### Creating Alerts

To create the alert, click the "Alerts" button from the main menu bar.

 ![](/media/media/image93.png)

We will display a page with tree tabs: Create new alerts in „Create
alert rule", manage alerts in „Alert rules List" and check alert
status „Alert Status".

 In the alert creation windows we have an alert creation form:

 ![](/media/media/image92.PNG)

 - **Name** - the name of the alert, after which we will recognize and
search for it.
- **Index pattern** - a pattern of indexes after which the alert will be
searched.
- **Role** - the role of the user for whom an alert will be available
- **Type** - type of alert
- **Description** - description of the alert.
- **Example** - an example of using a given type of alert. Descriptive
field
- **Alert method** - the action the alert will take if the conditions are
met (sending an email message or executing a command)
- **Any** - additional descriptive field.# List of Alert rules #

The "Alert Rule List" tab contain complete list of previously created 
alert rules:

![](/media/media/image94.png)

In this window, you can activate / deactivate, delete and update alerts 
by clicking on the selected icon with the given alert: ![](/media/media/image63.png).

### Alerts status

In the "Alert status" tab, you can check the current alert status: if
it activated, when it started and when it ended, how long it lasted,
how many event sit found and how many times it worked.

![](/media/media/image95.png)

Also, on this tab, you can recover the alert dashboard, by clicking the "Recovery Alert Dashboard" button.

### Alert Types

The various Rule Type classes, defined in ITRS Log Analytics. 
An instance is held in memory for each rule, passed all of the data returned by querying Elasticsearch 
with a given filter, and generates matches based on that data.

#### Any

The any rule will match everything. Every hit that the query returns will generate an alert.

#### Blacklist

The blacklist rule will check a certain field against a blacklist, and match if it is in the blacklist.

#### Whitelist

Similar to blacklist, this rule will compare a certain field to a whitelist, and match if the list does not contain the term.

#### Change

This rule will monitor a certain field and match if that field changes.

#### Frequency

This rule matches when there are at least a certain number of events in a given time frame.

#### Spike

This rule matches when the volume of events during a given time period is spike_height times larger or smaller than during the previous time period.

#### Flatline

This rule matches when the total number of events is under a given threshold for a time period.

#### New Term

This rule matches when a new value appears in a field that has never been seen before.

#### Cardinality

This rule matches when a the total number of unique values for a certain field within
a time frame is higher or lower than a threshold.

#### Metric Aggregation

This rule matches when the value of a metric within the calculation window is higher or lower than a threshold.

#### Percentage Match

This rule matches when the percentage of document in the match bucket within a calculation window is higher or lower than a threshold.

#### Unique Long Term

This rule matches when there are values of compare_key in each checked timeframe.

#### Find Match

Rule match when in defined period of time, two correlated documents match certain strings.

#### Consecutive Growth

Rule matches for value difference between two aggregations calculated for different periods in time.

#### Logical

Rule matches when a complex, logical criteria is met. Rule can be use for alert data correlation.

An example of using the Logical rule type.

![](/media/media/image149.png)

Alerts that must occur for the rule to be triggered:

- Switch - Port is off-line - the alert must appear 5 times.
  - OR
- Switch - Port is on-line - the alert must appear 5 times.

If both of the above alerts are met within no more than 5 minutes and the values of the "port_number" field are related to each other, the alert rule is triggered. It is possible to use logical connectives such as: OR, AND, NOR, NAND, XOR.

#### Chain

Rule matches when a complex, logical criteria is met. Rule can be use for alert data correlation.

An example of using the Chain rule type.

![](/media/media/image148.png)

Alerts that must occur for the rule to be triggered:

- Linux - Login Failure - the alert must appear 10 times.
- AND
- Linux - Login Success - 1 time triggered alert.

If the sequence of occurrence of the above alerts is met within 5 minutes and the values of the "username" field are related to each other, the alert rule is triggered. The order in which the component alerts occur is important.

#### Difference

This rule calculates percentage difference between aggregations for two non-overlapping time windows.

Let’s assume x represents the current time (i.e. when alert rule is run) then the relation between historical and present time windows is described by the inequality:
```
<x – agg_min – delta_min; x – delta_min> <= <x – agg_min; x>; where x – delta_min <= x – agg_min => delta_min >= agg_min
```
The percentage difference is then described by the following equation:
```
d = | avg_now – avg_history | / max(avg_now, avg_history) * 100; for (avg_now – avg_history != 0; avg_now != 0; avg_history != 0)
d = 0; (in other cases)
```
`avg_now` is the arithmetic mean of `<x – agg_min; x>`
`avg_history` is the arithmetic mean of `<x – agg_min – delta_min; x – delta_min>`

Required parameters:

- Enable the rule by setting type field.
`type: difference`
- Based on the compare_key field aggregation is calculated.
`compare_key: value`
- An alert is triggered when the percentage difference between aggregations is higher than the specified value.
`threshold_pct: 10`
- The difference in minutes between calculated aggregations.
`delta_min: 3`
- Aggregation bucket (in minutes).
`agg_min: 1`

Optional parameters:

If present, for each unique `query_key` aggregation is calculated (it needs to be of type keyword).
`query_key: hostname`

### Alert Methods

When the alert rule is fulfilled, the defined action is performed - the alert method.
The following alert methods have been predefined in the system:

- email;
- commands;
- user;

#### Email

Method that sends information about an alert to defined email addresses.

#### User

Method that sends information about an alert to defined system users.

#### Command

 A method that performs system tasks. For example, it triggers a script that creates a new event in the customer ticket system.

Below is an example of an alert rule definition that uses the "command" alert method to create and recover an ticket in the client's request system:

```bash
index: op5-*
name: change-op5-hoststate
type: change

compare_key: hoststate
ignore_null: true
query_key: hostname

filter:
- query_string:
    query: "_exists_: hoststate AND datatype: \"HOSTPERFDATA\" AND _exists_: hostname"

realert:
  minutes: 0
alert: "command"
command: ["/opt/alert/send_request_change.sh", "5", "%(hostname)s", "SYSTEM_DOWN", "HOST", "Application Collection", "%(hoststate)s", "%(@timestamp)s"]
```

The executed command has parameters which are the values of the fields of the executed alert. Syntax: `%(fields_name)`.

   - `Tags:` The tags attached to alert.
   - `Observable data mapping:` The key and the value observable data mapping.
   - `Alert text:` The text of content the alert.

### Aggregation

`aggregation:` This option allows you to aggregate multiple matches together into one alert. Every time a match is found, Alert will wait for the aggregation period, and send all of the matches that have occurred in that time for a particular rule together. \

For example:
```
aggregation:
  hours: 2
```
Means that if one match occurred at 12:00, another at 1:00, and a third at 2:30, one alert would be sent at 2:00, containing the first two matches, and another at 4:30, containing the third match plus any additional matches occurring before 4:30. This can be very useful if you expect a large number of matches and only want a periodic report. (Optional, time, default none) \

If you wish to aggregate all your alerts and send them on a recurring interval, you can do that using the schedule field. \
For example, if you wish to receive alerts every Monday and Friday:

```
aggregation:
  schedule: '2 4 * * mon,fri'
```

This uses Cron syntax, which you can read more about [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). Make sure to only include either a schedule field or standard datetime fields (such as hours, minutes, days), not both. \

By default, all events that occur during an aggregation window are grouped together. However, if your rule has the aggregation_key field set, then each event sharing a common key value will be grouped together. A separate aggregation window will be made for each newly encountered key value. \
For example, if you wish to receive alerts that are grouped by the userwho triggered the event, you can set:

```
aggregation_key: 'my_data.username'
```

Then, assuming an aggregation window of 10 minutes, if you receive the following data points:

```
{'my_data': {'username': 'alice', 'event_type': 'login'}, '@timestamp': '2016-09-20T00:00:00'}
{'my_data': {'username': 'bob', 'event_type': 'something'}, '@timestamp': '2016-09-20T00:05:00'}
{'my_data': {'username': 'alice', 'event_type': 'something else'}, '@timestamp': '2016-09-20T00:06:00'}
```

This should result in 2 alerts: One containing alice's two events, sent at 2016-09-20T00:10:00 and one containing bob's one event sent at 2016-09-20T00:16:00. \

For aggregations, there can sometimes be a large number of documents present in the viewing medium (email, Jira, etc..). If you set the summary_table_fields field, Alert will provide a summary of the specified fields from all the results. \

The formatting style of the summary table can be switched between ascii (default) and markdown with parameter summary_table_type. Markdown might be the more suitable formatting for alerters supporting it like TheHive or Energy Soar. \

The maximum number of rows in the summary table can be limited with the parameter `summary_table_max_rows`. \

For example, if you wish to summarize the usernames and event_types that appear in the documents so that you can see the most relevant fields at a quick glance, you can set:

```
summary_table_fields:
    - my_data.username
    - my_data.event_type
```

Then, for the same sample data shown above listing alice and bob's events, Alert will provide the following summary table in the alert medium:

```
+------------------+--------------------+
| my_data.username | my_data.event_type |
+------------------+--------------------+
|      alice       |       login        |
|       bob        |     something      |
|      alice       |   something else   |
+------------------+--------------------+
```

**!! NOTE !!**
```
By default, aggregation time is relative to the current system time, not the time of the match. This means that running Alert over past events will result in different alerts than if Alert had been running while those events occured. This behavior can be changed by setting `aggregate_by_match_time`.
```


### Alert Content

There are several ways to format the body text of the various types of events. In EBNF::

    rule_name           = name
    alert_text          = alert_text
    ruletype_text       = Depends on type
    top_counts_header   = top_count_key, ":"
    top_counts_value    = Value, ": ", Count
    top_counts          = top_counts_header, LF, top_counts_value
    field_values        = Field, ": ", Value

Similarly to ``alert_subject``, ``alert_text`` can be further formatted using standard Python formatting syntax.
The field names whose values will be used as the arguments can be passed with ``alert_text_args`` or ``alert_text_kw``.
You may also refer to any top-level rule property in the ``alert_subject_args``, ``alert_text_args``, ``alert_missing_value``, and ``alert_text_kw fields``.  However, if the matched document has a key with the same name, that will take preference over the rule property.

By default::

    body                = rule_name
    
                          [alert_text]
    
                          ruletype_text
    
                          {top_counts}
    
                          {field_values}

With ``alert_text_type: alert_text_only``::

    body                = rule_name
    
                          alert_text

With ``alert_text_type: exclude_fields``::

    body                = rule_name
    
                          [alert_text]
    
                          ruletype_text
    
                          {top_counts}

With ``alert_text_type: aggregation_summary_only``::

    body                = rule_name
    
                          aggregation_summary

ruletype_text is the string returned by RuleType.get_match_str.

field_values will contain every key value pair included in the results from Elasticsearch. These fields include "@timestamp" (or the value of ``timestamp_field``),
every key in ``include``, every key in ``top_count_keys``, ``query_key``, and ``compare_key``. If the alert spans multiple events, these values may
come from an individual event, usually the one which triggers the alert.

When using ``alert_text_args``, you can access nested fields and index into arrays. For example, if your match was ``{"data": {"ips": ["127.0.0.1", "12.34.56.78"]}}``, then by using ``"data.ips[1]"`` in ``alert_text_args``, it would replace value with ``"12.34.56.78"``. This can go arbitrarily deep into fields and will still work on keys that contain dots themselves.

To add a new playbook, go to the **Alert** module, select the **Playbook** tab and then **Create Playbook**

![](/media/media/image116.png)

In the **Name** field, enter the name of the new Playbook.

In the **Text** field, enter the content of the Playbook message.

In the **Script** field, enter the commands to be executed in the script.

To save the entered content, confirm with the **Submit** button.

#### Playbooks list  ###

To view saved Playbook, go to the **Alert** module, select the **Playbook** tab and then **Playbooks list**:

![](/media/media/image117.png)

To view the content of a given Playbook, select the **Show** button.

To enter the changes in a given Playbook or in its script, select the **Update** button. After making changes, select the **Submit** button.

To delete the selected Playbook, select the **Delete** button.

#### Linking Playbooks with alert rule ###

You can add a Playbook to the Alert while creating a new Alert or by editing a previously created Alert.

To add Palybook to the new Alert rule, go to the **Create alert rule** tab and in the **Playbooks** section use the arrow keys to move the correct Playbook to the right window.

To add a Palybook to existing Alert rule, go to the **Alert rule list** tab with the correct rule select the **Update** button and in the **Playbooks** section use the arrow keys to move the correct Playbook to the right window.

#### Playbook verification ###

When creating an alert or while editing an existing alert, it is possible that the system will indicate the most-suited playbook for the alert. For this purpose, the Validate button is used, which starts the process of searching the existing playbook and selects the most appropriate ones.

### Risks

ITRS Log Analytics allows you to estimate the risk based on the collected data. The risk is estimated based on the defined category to which the values from 0 to 100 are assigned.

Information on the defined risk for a given field is passed with an alert and multiplied by the value of the Rule Importance parameter.

Risk calculation does not use only logs for its work. Processing the security posture encounters all the information like user behaviour data, performance data, system inventory, running software, vulnerabilities and many more. Having large scope of information Your organization gather an easy way to score its security project and detect all missing spots of the design. Embedded deep expert knowledge is here to help.

#### Create category

To add a new risk Category, go to the **Alert** module, select the **Risks** tab and then **Create Cagtegory**. 

![](/media/media/image118.png)

Enter the **Name** for the new category and the category **Value**.

#### Category list

To view saved Category, go to the **Alert** module, select the **Risks** tab and then **Categories list**:

![](/media/media/image119.png)

To view the content of a given Category, select the **Show** button.

To change the value assigned to a category, select the **Update** button. After making changes, select the **Submit** button.

To delete the selected Category, select the **Delete** button.

#### Create risk

To add a new playbook, go to the Alert module, select the Playbook tab and then Create Playbook

![](/media/media/image120.png)

In the **Index pattern** field, enter the name of the index pattern.
Select the **Read fields** button to get a list of fields from the index.
From the box below, select the field name for which the risk will be determined.

From the **Timerange field**, select the time range from which the data will be analyzed.

Press the **Read valules** button to get values from the previously selected field for analysis.

Next, you must assign a risk category to the displayed values. You can do this for each value individually or use the check-box on the left to mark several values and set the category globally using the **Set global category** button. To quickly find the right value, you can use the search field.

![](/media/media/image122.png)

After completing, save the changes with the **Submit** button.

#### List risk

To view saved risks, go to the **Alert** module, select the **Risks** tab and then **Risks list**:

![](/media/media/image121.png)

To view the content of a given Risk, select the **Show** button.

To enter the changes in a given Risk, select the **Update** button. After making changes, select the **Submit** button.

To delete the selected Risk, select the **Delete** button.

#### Linking risk with alert rule

You can add a Risk key to the Alert while creating a new Alert or by editing a previously created Alert.

To add Risk key to the new Alert rule, go to the **Create alert rule** tab and after entering the index name, select the **Read fields** button and in the **Risk key** field, select the appropriate field name.
In addition, you can enter the validity of the rule in the **Rule Importance** field (in the range 1-100%), by which the risk will be multiplied.

To add Risk key to the existing Alert rule, go to the **Alert rule list**, tab with the correct rule select the **Update** button. 
Use the **Read fields** button and in the **Risk key** field, select the appropriate field name.
In addition, you can enter the validity of the rule in the **Rule Importance**.

#### Risk calculation algorithms

The risk calculation mechanism performs the aggregation of the risk field values.
We have the following algorithms for calculating the alert risk (Aggregation type):

- min - returns the minimum value of the risk values from selected fields;
- max - returns the maximum value of the risk values from selected fields;
- avg - returns the average of risk values from selected fields;
- sum - returns the sum of risk values from selected fields;
- custom - returns the risk value based on your own algorithm

#### Adding a new risk calculation algorithm

The new algorithm should be added in the `./elastalert_modules/playbook_util.py` file in the `calculate_risk` method. There is a sequence of conditional statements for already defined algorithms:

	#aggregate values by risk_key_aggregation for rule
	if risk_key_aggregation == "MIN":
	    value_agg = min(values)
	elif risk_key_aggregation == "MAX":
	    value_agg = max(values)
	elif risk_key_aggregation == "SUM":
	    value_agg = sum(values)
	elif risk_key_aggregation == "AVG":
	    value_agg = sum(values)/len(values)
	else:
	    value_agg = max(values)

To add a new algorithm, add a new sequence as shown in the above code:

	elif risk_key_aggregation == "AVG":
	    value_agg = sum(values)/len(values)
	elif risk_key_aggregation == "AAA":
	    value_agg = BBB
	else:
	    value_agg = max(values)

where **AAA** is the algorithm code, **BBB** is a risk calculation function.

#### Using the new algorithm

After adding a new algorithm, it is available in the GUI in the Alert tab.

To use it, add a new rule according to the following steps:

- Select the `custom` value in the `Aggregation` type field;
- Enter the appropriate value in the `Any` field, e.g. `risk_key_aggregation: AAA`

The following figure shows the places where you can call your own algorithm:

![](/media/media/image123.png)

#### Additional modification of the algorithm (weight)

Below is the code in the `calcuate_risk` method where category values are retrieved - here you can add your weight:

            #start loop by tablicy risk_key
            for k in range(len(risk_keys)):
                risk_key = risk_keys[k]
                logging.info(' >>>>>>>>>>>>>> risk_key: ')
                logging.info(risk_key)
                key_value = lookup_es_key(match, risk_key)
                logging.info(' >>>>>>>>>>>>>> key_value: ')
                logging.info(key_value)
                value = float(self.get_risk_category_value(risk_key, key_value))
                values.append( value )
                logging.info(' >>>>>>>>>>>>>> risk_key values: ')
                logging.info(values)
            #finish loop by tablicy risk_key
            #aggregate values by risk_key_aggregation form rule
            if risk_key_aggregation == "MIN":
                value_agg = min(values)
            elif risk_key_aggregation == "MAX":
                value_agg = max(values)
            elif risk_key_aggregation == "SUM":
                value_agg = sum(values)
            elif risk_key_aggregation == "AVG":
                value_agg = sum(values)/len(values)
            else:
                value_agg = max(values)

`Risk_key` is the array of selected risk key fields in the GUI.
A loop is made on this array and a value is collected for the categories in the line:

	value = float(self.get_risk_category_value(risk_key, key_value))

Based on, for example, Risk_key, you can multiply the value of the value field by the appropriate weight.
The value field value is then added to the table on which the risk calculation algorithms are executed.

### Incidents

SIEM correlation engine allows automatically scores organization security posture showing You what tactic the attacked use and how this puts organization at risk. Every attack can be traced on dashboard reflecting Your security design identifying missing enforcements.

Incidents on the operation of the organization through appropriate points for caught incidents. Hazard situations are presented, using the so-called Mitre ATT / CK matrix. The ITRS Log Analytics system, in addition to native integration with MITER, allows this knowledge to be correlated with other collected data and logs, creating even more complex techniques of behavior detection and analysis. Advanced approach allows for efficient analysis of security design estimation.

The Incident module allows you to handle incidents created by triggered alert rules. 

![](/media/media/image154.png)

Incident handling allows you to perform the following action:

- *Show incident* - shows the details that generated the incident;
- *Verify* - checks the IP addresses of those responsible for causing an incident with the system reputation lists;
- *Preview* - takes you to the Discover module and to the raw document responsible for generating the incident;
- *Update* - allows you to change the Incident status or transfer the incident handling to another user. Status list: *New, Ongoing, False, Solved.*
- *Playbooks* - enables handling of Playbooks assigned to an incident;
- *Note* - User notes about the incident;

#### Incident Escalation

The alarm rule definition allows an incident to be escalated if the incident status does not change (from New to Ongoing) after a defined time.

Configuration parameter

- *escalate_users* - an array of users who get an email alert about the escalation;
- *escalate_after* - the time after which the escalation is triggered;

Example of configuration:

```yaml
escalate_users:["user2", "user3"] 
escalate_after:
	- hours: 6
```

#### Context menu for Alerts::Incidents

In this section, you will find steps and examples that will allow you to add custom items in the actions context menu for the Incidents table. This allows you to expand on the functionalities of the system.

##### Important file paths

- `/usr/share/kibana/plugins/alerts/public/reactui/incidenttab.js`
- `/usr/share/kibana/optimize/bundles/`

##### List element template

```javascript
{
  name: 'Name of the Action to add',
  icon: 'Name of the chosen icon',
  type: 'icon',
  onClick: this.runActionFunction,
}
```
You should pick the icon from available choices. After listing `ls /usr/share/kibana/built_assets/dlls/icon*` if you want to use:
- `icon.editor_align_center-js.bundle.dll.js`  
The for `icon: ` you should set:  
- `editorAlignCenter`  
Use the same transformation for each icon.

##### Action function template

```javascript
runActionFunction = item => {
  // Functino logic to run => information from "item" object can be used here
};
```
Object "item" contains information about the incident that action was used on.

##### Steps to add the first custom action to the codebase

1. Create backup of a file you are about to modify:

   ```bash
   cp /usr/share/kibana/plugins/alerts/public/reactui/incidenttab.js ~/incidenttab.js.bak
   ```

   

2. Working example for the onClick function and action item:

   ```javascript
   showMyLocation = () => {
     const opt = {
       enableHighAccuracy: true,
       timeout: 5000,
       maximumAge: 0
     };
     const success = pos => {
       const crd = pos.coords;
       alert(`Your current position is:\nLatitude: ${
         crd.latitude
       }\nLongitude: ${
         crd.longitude
       }\nMore or less ${
         crd.accuracy
       } meters.`);
     }
     const err = err => {
       alert(`ERROR(${err.code}): ${err.message}`);
     }
     navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, err, opt);
   }
   
   const customActions = [
     {
       name: 'Show my location',
       icon: 'broom',
       type: 'icon',
       onClick: this.showMyLocation,
     }
   ];
   incidentactions.push(...customActions);
   ```

   

3. The "showMyLocation" function code should be placed in `/usr/share/kibana/plugins/alerts/public/reactui/incidenttab.js` under:

   ```javascript
     showIncidentModal = incident => {
       const updateIncident = incident;
       this.setState({ showIncidentModal: true, updateIncident });
     };
   
     // paste function here
   
     render() {
   ```

   

4. Custom action with a `push` function should be placed:

   ```javascript
         {
           name: 'Note',
           icon: 'pencil',
           type: 'icon',
           isPrimary: true,
           color: 'danger',
           onClick: this.note,
         },
       ];
   
       // insert HERE your action with function 'push'
   
       const incidentcolumns = [
   ```

   

5. For the changes to take effect run below commands on the client serwer (as root or with sudo):

   ```bash
   systemctl stop kibana
   rm -rf /usr/share/kibana/optimize/bundles
   systemctl start kibana
   # verify that process runs correctly afterwards
   journalctl -fu kibana
   # in case of errors restore backup
   ```

   

6. You should now be able to see an additional item in the action context menu in GUI Alerts::Incidents:

   ![](/media/media/image202.png)

   

7. Running the action will resolve into an alert:  

   ![](/media/media/image203.png)

   

##### Steps to add a second and subsequent custom actions

1. Execute identicly as in the last section.

2. Example of a function that uses `item` object. It will open a new tab in the browser with the default [Alert] dashboard with a custom filter and time set, based on information from the passed `item` variable:

   ```javascript
   openAlertDashboardWithFilter = item => {
     const ruleName = `"${item.rule_name}"`;
     const startT = new Date(item.match_time);
     startT.setHours(0);
     const endT = new Date(item.match_time);
     endT.setHours(24);
     const alertDashboardPath =
       '/app/kibana#/dashboard/777ace50-d200-11e8-98f8-31520a7f9701';
     const timeQuery = 
       `_g=(time:(from:'${startT.toISOString()}',to:'${endT.toISOString()}'))`;
     const nameQuery = 
       `_a=(query:(language:lucene,query:'rule_name:${encodeURIComponent(
         ruleName
       )}'))`;
     const dashboardLocation = `${alertDashboardPath}?${timeQuery}&${nameQuery}`;
     window.open(dashboardLocation, '_blank');
   };
   ``` 

3. Execute identicly as in the last section.

4. The difference in adding subsequent action is that you append a new one to `customActions` array variable. The rest should stay the same:

   ```javascript
   const customActions = [
     {
       name: 'Show my location',
       icon: 'broom',
       type: 'icon',
       onClick: this.showMyLocation,
     },
     {
       name: 'Show on Dashboard',
       icon: 'arrowRight',
       type: 'icon',
       onClick: this.openAlertDashboardWithFilter,
     },
   ];
   incidentactions.push(...customActions);
   ```

   

5. Execute identicly as in the last section.

6. Now both actions should be present on the context menu:

   ![](/media/media/image204.png)

7. Using it will open dashboard in new tab:

   ![](/media/media/image205.png)

##### System update

When updating the system your changes might be overwritten. You should in that case save a backup of your changes and restore them after the update with the use of this instruction. Or for instance, with `vimdiff` compare your changes with the original file:

```bash
vimdiff ~/incidenttab.js.bak /usr/share/kibana/plugins/alerts/public/reactui/incidenttab.js
```

### Indicators of compromise (IoC)

ITRS Log Analytics  has the Indicators of compromise (IoC) functionality, which is based on the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP).
IoC observes the logs sent to the system and marks documents if their content is in MISP signature.
Based on IoC markings, you can build alert rules or track incident behavior.

#### Configuration

##### Bad IP list update

To update bad reputation lists and to create `.blacklists` index, you have to run following scripts:

```bash
/etc/logstash/lists/bin/misp_threat_lists.sh
```

##### Scheduling bad IP lists update

This can be done in `cron` (host with Logstash installed):

```bash
0 6 * * * logstash /etc/logstash/lists/bin/misp_threat_lists.sh
```

or with Kibana Scheduller app (**only if Logstash is running on the same host**).

- Prepare script path:

```bash
/bin/ln -sfn /etc/logstash/lists/bin /opt/ai/bin/lists
chown logstash:kibana /etc/logstash/lists/
chmod g+w /etc/logstash/lists/
```

- Log in to ITRS Log Analytics GUI and go to **Scheduler** app. Set it up with below options and push "Submit" button:

```bash
Name:           MispThreatList
Cron pattern:   0 1 * * *
Command:        lists/misp_threat_lists.sh
Category:       logstash
```

After a couple of minutes check for blacklists index:

```bash
curl -sS -u user:password -XGET '127.0.0.1:9200/_cat/indices/.blacklists?s=index&v'
health status index       uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   .blacklists Mld2Qe2bSRuk2VyKm-KoGg   1   0      76549            0      4.7mb          4.7mb
```



### Calendar function

The alert rule can be executed based on a schedule called Calendar.

#### Create a calendar

The configuration of the **Calendar Function** should be done in the definition of the `Rule Definition` alert using the `calendar` and `scheduler` options, in **Crontab** format.

For example, we want to have an alert that:

- triggers only on working days from 8:00 to 16:00;

- only triggers on weekends;

```bash
calendar:
  schedule: "* 8-15 * * mon-fri"
```

If `aggregation` is used in the alert definition, remember that the aggregation schedule should be the same as the defined calendar.

#### Netflow analyzis

The Logstash collector receives and decodes Network Flows using the provided decoders. During decoding, IP address reputation analysis is performed and the result is added to the event document.

#### Installation

##### Install/update logstash codec plugins for netflox and sflow

```bash
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install file:///etc/logstash/plugins/logstash-codec-sflow-2.1.3.gem.zip
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install file:///etc/logstash/plugins/logstash-codec-netflow-4.2.1.gem.zip
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install file:///etc/logstash/plugins/logstash-input-udp-3.3.4.gem.zip
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-input-tcp
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-filter-translate
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-filter-geoip
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-filter-dns
```

#### Configuration

##### Enable Logstash pipeline

```bash
vim /etc/logstash/pipeline.yml

- pipeline.id: flows
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/conf.d/netflow/*.conf"
```

##### Elasticsearch template installation

Information:    Code Integrity is a feature that improves the security of the operating system by validating the integrity of a driver or system file each time it is loaded into memory.
    Code Integrity detects whether an unsigned driver or system file is being loaded into the kernel, or whether a system file has been modified by malicious software that is being run by a user account with administrative permissions.
    On x64-based versions of the operating system, kernel-mode drivers must be digitally signed.

# Alert Module #

ITRS Log Analytics allows you to create alerts, i.e. monitoring
queries. These are constant queries that run in the background and
when the conditions specified in the alert are met, the specify action
is taken. 

![](/media/media/image91.PNG)

For example, if you want to know when more than 20
„status:500" response code from on our homepage appear within an one
hour, then we create an alert that check the number of occurrences of
the „status:500" query for a specific index every 5 minutes. If the
condition we are interested in is met, we send an action in the form
of sending a message to our e-mail address. In the action, you can
also set the launch of any script.

### Incident detection and mitigation time

The ITRS Log Analytics allows you to keep track of the time and actions taken in the incident you created. 
A detected alert incident has the date the incident occurred `match_body.@timestamp` and the date and time the incident was detected `alert.time`. 

In addition, it is possible to enrich the alert event with the date and time of incident resolution `alert_solvedtime` using the following pipeline:

```conf
  input {
      elasticsearch {
          hosts => "http://localhost:9200"
          user => logserver
          password => logserver
          index => "alert*"
          size => 500
          scroll => "5m"
          docinfo => true
          schedule => "*/5 * * * *"
          query => '{ "query": {     "bool": {
        "must": [
          {
            "match_all": {}
          }
        ],
        "filter": [
          {
            "match_phrase": {
              "alert_info.status": {
                "query": "solved"
              }
            }
          }
        ],
        "should": [],
        "must_not": [{
            "exists": {
              "field": "alert_solvedtime"
            }
          }]
      }
  }, "sort": [ "_doc" ] }'
      }
  }
  filter {
          ruby {
                  code => "event.set('alert_solvedtime', Time.now());"
          }
  }
  output {
      elasticsearch {
          hosts => "http://localhost:9200"
          user => logserver
          password => logserver
          action => "update"
          document_id => "%{[@metadata][_id]}"
          index => "%{[@metadata][_index]}"
      }
  }
```

### Adding a tag to an existing alert
We can add a tag to an existing alert using the dev tools.
You can use belowe code.

```bash
POST alert/_update/example_document_id
{
  "doc": {
    "tags":"example"
  }
}
```

## Siem Module

ITRS Log Analytics, through its built-in vulnerability detection module use of best practices defined in the CIS, allows to audit monitored environment for security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or outdated software versions. File Integrity Monitoring functionality allows for detailed monitoring and alerting of unauthorized access attempts to most sensitive data.

SIEM Plan is a solution that provides a ready-made set of tools for compliance regulations such as CIS, PCI DSS, GDPR, NIST 800-53, ISO 27001.The system enables mapping of detected threats to Mitre ATT&CK tactics. By integrating with the MISP ITRS Log Analytics, allows to get real-time information about new threats on the network by downloading the latest IoC lists.

To configure the SIEM agents see the *Configuration* section.

### Active response

The SIEM agent automates the response to threats by running actions when these are detected. The agent has the ability to block network connections, stop running processes, and delete malicious files, among other actions. In addition, it can also run customized scripts developed by the user (e.g., Python, Bash, or PowerShell).

To use this feature, users define the conditions that trigger the scripted actions, which usually involve threat detection and assessment. For example, a user can use log analysis rules to detect an intrusion attempt and an IP address reputation database to assess the threat by looking for the source IP address of the attempted connection.

In the scenario described above, when the source IP address is recognized as malicious (low reputation), the monitored system is protected by automatically setting up a firewall rule to drop all traffic from the attacker. Depending on the active response, this firewall rule is temporary or permanent.

On Linux systems, the Wazuh agent usually integrates with the local Iptables firewall for this purpose. On Windows systems, instead, it uses the null routing technique (also known as blackholing). Below you can find the configuration to define two scripts that are used for automated connection blocking:

```xml
    <command>
      <name>firewall-drop</name>
      <executable>firewall-drop</executable>
      <timeout_allowed>yes</timeout_allowed>
    </command>
```

```xml
    <command>
      <name>win_route-null</name>
      <executable>route-null.exe</executable>
      <timeout_allowed>yes</timeout_allowed>
    </command>
```

On top of the defined commands, active responses set the conditions that need to be met to trigger them. Below is an example of a configuration that triggers the ``firewall-drop`` command when the log analysis rule ``100100`` is matched.

```xml
    <active-response>
      <command>firewall-drop</command>
      <location>local</location>
      <rules_id>100100</rules_id>
      <timeout>60</timeout>
    </active-response>
```

In this case, rule ``100100`` is used to look for alerts where the source IP address is part of a well-known IP address reputation database.

```xml
   <rule id="100100" level="10">
     <if_group>web|attack|attacks</if_group>
     <list field="srcip" lookup="address_match_key">etc/lists/blacklist-alienvault</list>
     <description>IP address found in AlienVault reputation database.</description>
   </rule>
```

Below you can find a screenshot with two SIEM alerts: one that is triggered when a web attack is detected trying to exploit a PHP server vulnerability, and one that informs that the malicious actor has been blocked.

### Log data collection

Log data collection is the real-time process of making sense out of the records generated by servers or devices. This component can receive logs through text files or Windows event logs. It can also directly receive logs via remote syslog which is useful for firewalls and other such devices.

The purpose of this process is the identification of application or system errors, mis-configurations, intrusion attempts, policy violations or security issues.

The memory and CPU requirements of the SIEM agent are insignificant since its primary duty is to forward events to the manager. However, on the SIEM manager, CPU and memory consumption can increase rapidly depending on the events per second (EPS) that the manager has to analyze.

#### How it works
Log files
The Log analysis engine can be configured to monitor specific files on the servers.

Linux:
```xml
<localfile>
  <location>/var/log/example.log</location>
  <log_format>syslog</log_format>
</localfile>
```
Windows:
```xml
<localfile>
  <location>C:\myapp\example.log</location>
  <log_format>syslog</log_format>
</localfile>
```

Windows event logs
Wazuh can monitor classic Windows event logs, as well as the newer Windows event channels.
Event log:
```xml
<localfile>
  <location>Security</location>
  <log_format>eventlog</log_format>
</localfile>
```

Event channel:
```xml
<localfile>
  <location>Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational</location>
  <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
</localfile>
```

Remote syslog
In order to integrate network devices such as routers, firewalls, etc, the log analysis component can be configured to receive log events through syslog. To do that we have two methods available:

One option is for SIEM to receive syslog logs by a custom port:
```xml
<ossec_config>
  <remote>
    <connection>syslog</connection>
    <port>513</port>
    <protocol>udp</protocol>
    <allowed-ips>192.168.2.0/24</allowed-ips>
  </remote>
</ossec_config>
```

```<connection>syslog</connection>``` indicates that the manager will accept incoming syslog messages from across the network.
```<port>513</port>``` defines the port that Wazuh will listen to retrieve the logs. The port must be free.
```<protocol>udp</protocol>``` defines the protocol to listen the port. It can be UDP or TCP.
```<allowed-ips>192.168.2.0/24</allowed-ips>```defines the network or IP from which syslog messages will be accepted.

The other option store the logs in a plaintext file and monitor that file with SIEM. If a ```/etc/rsyslog.conf``` configuration file is being used and we have defined where to store the syslog logs we can monitor them in SIEM ```ossec.conf``` using a ```<localfile>``` block with ```syslog``` as the log format.

```xml
<localfile>
  <log_format>syslog</log_format>
  <location>/custom/file/path</location>
</localfile>
```

```<log_format>syslog</log_format>``` indicates the source log format, in this case, syslog format.
```<location>/custom/file/path</location>``` indicates where we have stored the syslog logs.

Analysis
Pre-decoding

In the pre-decoding phase of analysis, static information from well-known fields all that is extracted from the log header.
```bash
Feb 14 12:19:04 localhost sshd[25474]: Accepted password for rromero from 192.168.1.133 port 49765 ssh2
```

Extracted information:
- hostname: 'localhost'
- program_name: 'sshd'

Decoding

In the decoding phase, the log message is evaluated to identify what type of log it is and known fields for that specific log type are then extracted.
Sample log and its extracted info:
```bash
Feb 14 12:19:04 localhost sshd[25474]: Accepted password for rromero from 192.168.1.133 port 49765 ssh2
```
Extracted information:
- program name: sshd
- dstuser: rromero
- srcip: 192.168.1.133

Rule matching
In the next phase, the extracted log information is compared to the ruleset to look for matches:
For the previous example, rule 5715 is matched:

```xml
<rule id="5715" level="3">
  <if_sid>5700</if_sid>
  <match>^Accepted|authenticated.$</match>
  <description>sshd: authentication success.</description>
  <group>authentication_success,pci_dss_10.2.5,</group>
</rule>
```

Alert
Once a rule is matched, the manager will create an alert as below:
```bash
** Alert 1487103546.21448: - syslog,sshd,authentication_success,pci_dss_10.2.5,
2017 Feb 14 12:19:06 localhost->/var/log/secure
Rule: 5715 (level 3) -> 'sshd: authentication success.'
Src IP: 192.168.1.133
User: rromero
Feb 14 12:19:04 localhost sshd[25474]: Accepted password for rromero from 192.168.1.133 port 49765 ssh2
```

By default, alerts will be generated on events that are important or of security relevance. To store all events even if they do not match a rule, enable the ```<logall>``` option.

Alerts will be stored at ```/var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.(json|log)``` and events at ```/var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.(json|log)```. Logs are rotated and an individual directory is created for each month and year.

#### How to collect Windows logs

Windows events can be gathered and forwarded to the manager, where they are processed and alerted if they match any rule. There are two formats to collect Windows logs:

- Eventlog (supported by every Windows version)
- Eventchannel (for Windows Vista and later versions)

Windows logs are descriptive messages which come with relevant information about events that occur in the system. They are collected and shown at the Event Viewer, where they are classified by the source that generated them.

This information is gathered by the Windows agent, including the event description, the ```system``` standard fields and the specific ```eventdata``` information from the event. Once an event is sent to the manager, it is processed and translated to JSON format, which leads to an easier way of querying and filtering the event fields.

Eventlog uses as well the Windows API to obtain events from Windows logs and return the information in a specific format.


Windows Eventlog vs Windows Eventchannel
Eventlog is supported on every Windows version and can monitor any logs except for particular Applications and Services Logs, this means that the information that can be retrieved is reduced to System, Application and Security channels.
On the other hand, Eventchannel is maintained since Windows Vista and can monitor the Application and Services logs along with the basic Windows logs. In addition, the use of queries to filter by any field is supported for this log format.

Monitor the Windows Event Log with Wazuh
To monitor a Windows event log, it is necessary to provide the format as "eventlog" and the location as the name of the event log.
```xml
<localfile>
    <location>Security</location>
    <log_format>eventlog</log_format>
</localfile>
```
These logs are obtained through Windows API calls and sent to the manager where they will be alerted if they match any rule.

Monitor the Windows Event Channel with Wazuh
Windows event channels can be monitored by placing their name at the location field from the localfile block and "eventchannel" as the log format.
```xml
<localfile>
    <location>Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Operational</location>
    <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
</localfile>
```

When monitoring a channel, events from different providers can be gathered. At the ruleset this is taken into account to monitor logs from McAfee, Eventlog or Security Essentials.

Windows ruleset redesign

In order to ease the addition of new rules, the eventchannel ruleset has been classified according to the channel from which events belong. This will ensure an easier way of maintaining the ruleset organized and find the better place for custom rules. To accomplish this, several modifications have been added:

- Each eventchannel file contains a specific channel's rules.
- A base file includes every parent rule filtering by the specific channels monitored.
- Rules have been updated and improved to match the new JSON events, showing relevant information at the rule's description and facilitating the way of filtering them.
- New channel's rules have been added. By default, the monitored channels are System, Security and Application, these channels have their own file now and include a fair set of rules.
- Every file has their own rule ID range in order to get it organized. There are a hundred IDs set for the base rules and five hundred for each channel file.
- In case some rules can't be classified easily or there are so few belonging to a specific channel, they are included at a generic Windows rule file.

To have a complete view of which events are equivalent to the old ones from ```eventlog``` and the previous version of ```eventchannel```, this table classifies every rule according to the source in which they were recorded, including their range of rule IDs and the file where they are described.

#### Configuration

Basic usage

Log data collection is configured in the ```ossec.conf``` file primarily in the ```localfile```, ```remote``` and ```global``` sections. Configuration of log data collection can also be completed in the ```agent.conf``` file to centralize the distribution of these configuration settings to relevant agents.

As in this basic usage example, provide the name of the file to be monitored and the format:

```xml
<localfile>
  <location>/var/log/messages</location>
  <log_format>syslog</log_format>
</localfile>
```

Monitoring logs using wildcard patterns for file names
Wazuh supports posix wildcard patterns, just like listing files in a terminal. For example, to analyze every file that ends with a .log inside the ```/var/log``` directory, use the following configuration:

```xml
<localfile>
    <location>/var/log/*.log</location>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
</localfile>
```

Monitoring date-based logs
For log files that change according to the date, you can also specify a strftime format to replace the day, month, year, etc. For example, to monitor the log files like ```C:\Windows\app\log-08-12-15.log```, where 08 is the year, 12 is the month and 15 the day (and it is rolled over every day), configuration is as follows:

```xml
<localfile>
    <location>C:\Windows\app\log-%y-%m-%d.log</location>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
</localfile>
```

Using environment variables 
Environment variables like ```%WinDir%``` can be used in the location pattern. The following is an example of reading logs from an IIS server:

```xml
<localfile>
    <location>%SystemDrive%\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex%y%m%d.log</location>
    <log_format>iis</log_format>
</localfile>
```

Using multiple outputs
Log data is sent to the agent socket by default, but it is also possible to specify other sockets as output. ```ossec-logcollector``` uses UNIX type sockets to communicate allowing TCP or UDP protocols.

To add a new output socket we need to specify it using the tag ```<socket>``` as shown in the following example configuration:

```xml
<socket>
    <name>custom_socket</name>
    <location>/var/run/custom.sock</location>
    <mode>tcp</mode>
    <prefix>custom_syslog: </prefix>
</socket>

<socket>
    <name>test_socket</name>
    <location>/var/run/test.sock</location>
</socket>
```

Once the socket is defined, it's possible to add the destination socket for each localfile:

```xml
<localfile>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
    <location>/var/log/messages</location>
    <target>agent,test_socket</target>
</localfile>

<localfile>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
    <location>/var/log/messages</location>
    <target>custom_socket,test_socket</target>
</localfile>
```

### File integrity monitoring

#### How it works

The FIM module is located in the SIEM agent, where runs periodic scans of the system and stores the checksums and attributes of the monitored files and Windows registry keys in a local FIM database. The module looks for the modifications by comparing the new files’ checksums to the old checksums. All detected changes are reported to the SIEM manager.

The new FIM synchronization mechanism ensures the file inventory in the SIEM manager is always updated with respect to the SIEM agent, allowing servicing FIM-related API queries regarding the Wazuh agents. The FIM synchronization is based on periodic calculations of integrity between the SIEM agent’s and the SIEM manager’s databases, updating in the SIEM manager only those files that are outdated, optimizing the data transfer of FIM. Anytime the modifications are detected in the monitored files and/or registry keys, an alert is generated.

By default, each SIEM agent has the syscheck enabled and preconfigured but it is recommended to review and amend the configuration of the monitored host.

File integrity monitoring results for the whole environment can be observed in Energylogserver app in the SIEM > Overview > Integrity monitoring:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42172770/209820768-dd08601e-5d21-4b22-b82b-21aa98c01201.png)

#### Configuration

Syscheck component is configured both in the SIEM manager's and in the SIEM agent's ossec.conf file. This capability can be also configured remotely using centralized configuration and the agent.conf file. The list of all syscheck configuration options is available in the syscheck section.

Configuring syscheck - basic usage
To configure syscheck, a list of files and directories must be identified. The ```check_all``` attribute of the directories option allows checks of the file size, permissions, owner, last modification date, inode and all the hash sums (MD5, SHA1 and SHA256). By default, syscheck scans selected directories, whose list depends on the default configuration for the host's operating system.

```xml
<syscheck>
  <directories check_all="yes">/etc,/usr/bin,/usr/sbin</directories>
  <directories check_all="yes">/root/users.txt,/bsd,/root/db.html</directories>
</syscheck>
```

It is possible to hot-swap the monitored directories. This can be done for Linux, in both the SIEM agent and the SIEM manager, by setting the monitoring of symbolic links to directories. To set the refresh interval, use ```syscheck.symlink_scan_interval``` option found in the ```internal configuration``` of the monitored SIEM agent.

Once, the directory path is removed from the syscheck configuration and the SIEM agent is being restarted, the data from the previously monitored path is no longer stored in the FIM database.

Configuring scan time 
By default, syscheck scans when the SIEM starts, however, this behavior can be changed with the scan_on_start option.

For the schedluled scans, syscheck has an option to configure the frequency of the system scans. In this example, syscheck is configured to run every 10 hours:
```xml
<syscheck>
  <frequency>36000</frequency>
  <directories>/etc,/usr/bin,/usr/sbin</directories>
  <directories>/bin,/sbin</directories>
</syscheck>
```

There is an alternative way to schedule the scans using the ```scan_time``` and the ```scan_day``` options. In this example, the scan will run every Saturday at the 10pm. Configuring syscheck that way might help, for example, to set up the scans outside the environment production hours:

```xml
<syscheck>
  <scan_time>10pm</scan_time>
  <scan_day>saturday</scan_day>
  <directories>/etc,/usr/bin,/usr/sbin</directories>
  <directories>/bin,/sbin</directories>
</syscheck>
```

Configuring real-time monitoring
Real-time monitoring is configured with the ```realtime``` attribute of the ```directories``` option. This attribute only works with the directories rather than with the individual files. Real-time change detection is paused during periodic syscheck scans and reactivates as soon as these scans are complete:

```xml
<syscheck>
  <directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">c:/tmp</directories>
</syscheck>
```

Configuring who-data monitoring 
Who-data monitoring is configured with the ```whodata``` attribute of the ```directories``` option. This attribute replaces the ```realtime``` attribute, which means that ```whodata``` implies real-time monitoring but adding the who-data information. This functionality uses Linux Audit subsystem and the Microsoft Windows SACL, so additional configurations might be necessary. Check the ```auditing who-data entry``` to get further information:

```xml
<syscheck>
  <directories check_all="yes" whodata="yes">/etc</directories>
</syscheck>
```
Configuring reporting new files 
To report new files added to the system, syscheck can be configured with the alert_new_files option. By default, this feature is enabled on the monitored SIEM agent, but the option is not present in the syscheck section of the configuration:

```xml
<syscheck>
  <alert_new_files>yes</alert_new_files>
</syscheck>
```

Configuring reporting file changes
To report the exact content that has been changed in a text file, syscheck can be configured with the ```report_changes``` attribute of the ```directories``` option. ```Report_changes``` should be used with caution as Wazuh copies every single monitored file to a private location.

```xml
<syscheck>
  <directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes" report_changes="yes">/test</directories>
</syscheck>
```

If some sentive files exist in the monitored with report_changes path, nodiff option can be used. This option disables computing the diff for the listed files, avoiding data leaking by sending the files content changes through alerts:

```xml
<syscheck>
  <directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes" report_changes="yes">/test</directories>
  <nodiff>/test/private</nodiff>
</syscheck>
```

Configuring ignoring files and Windows registry entries
In order to avoid false positives, syscheck can be configured to ignore certain files and directories that do not need to be monitored by using the ```ignore``` option:

```xml
<syscheck>
  <ignore>/etc/random-seed</ignore>
  <ignore>/root/dir</ignore>
  <ignore type="sregex">.log$|.tmp</ignore>
</syscheck>
```

Similar functionality, but for the Windows registries can be achieved by using the ```registry_ignore``` option:

```xml
<syscheck>
 <registry_ignore>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Security\Policy\Secrets</registry_ignore>
 <registry_ignore type="sregex">\Enum$</registry_ignore>
</syscheck>
```

Configuring ignoring files via rules 
An alternative method to ignore specific files scanned by syscheck is by using rules and setting the rule level to 0. By doing that the alert will be silenced:
```xml
<rule id="100345" level="0">
  <if_group>syscheck</if_group>
  <match>/var/www/htdocs</match>
  <description>Ignore changes to /var/www/htdocs</description>
</rule>
```

Configuring the alert severity for the monitored files
With a custom rule, the level of a syscheck alert can be altered when changes to a specific file or file pattern are detected:
```xml
<rule id="100345" level="12">
  <if_group>syscheck</if_group>
  <match>/var/www/htdocs</match>
  <description>Changes to /var/www/htdocs - Critical file!</description>
</rule>
```

Configuring maximum recursion level allowed 
It is possible to configure the maximum recursion level allowed for a specific directory by using the recursion_level attribute of the directories option. recursion_level value must be an integer between 0 and 320.

An example configuration may look as follows:

```xml
<syscheck>
  <directories check_all="yes">/etc,/usr/bin,/usr/sbin</directories>
  <directories check_all="yes">/root/users.txt,/bsd,/root/db.html</directories>
  <directories check_all="yes" recursion_level="3">folder_test</directories>
</syscheck>
```

Configuring syscheck process priority 
To adjust syscheck CPU usage on the monitored system the ```process_priority``` option can be used. It sets the nice value for syscheck process. The default ```process_priority``` is set to 10.

Setting ```process_priority``` value higher than the default, will give syscheck lower priority, less CPU resources and make it run slower. In the example below the nice value for syscheck process is set to maximum:
```xml
<syscheck>
  <process_priority>19</process_priority>
</syscheck>
```

Setting process_priority value lower than the default, will give syscheck higher priority, more CPU resources and make it run faster. In the example below the nice value for syscheck process is set to minimum:
```xml
<syscheck>
  <process_priority>-20</process_priority>
</syscheck>
```

Configuring where the database is to be stored
When the SIEM agent starts it performs a first scan and generates its database. By default, the database is created in disk:
```xml
<syscheck>
  <database>disk</database>
</syscheck>
```
Syscheck can be configured to store the database in memory instead by changing value of the database option:
```xml
<syscheck>
  <database>memory</database>
</syscheck>
```
The main advantage of using in memory database is the performance as reading and writing operations are faster than performing them on disk. The corresponding disadvantage is that the memory must be sufficient to store the data.

Configuring synchronization
Synchronization can be configured to change the synchronization interval, the number of events per second, the queue size and the response timeout:
```xml
<syscheck>
  <synchronization>
    <enabled>yes</enabled>
    <interval>5m</interval>
    <max_interval>1h</max_interval>
    <response_timeout>30</response_timeout>
    <queue_size>16384</queue_size>
    <max_eps>10</max_eps>
  </synchronization>
</syscheck>
```

### Active response

#### How it works 

When is an active response triggered?

An active response is a script that is configured to execute when a specific alert, alert level or rule group has been triggered. Active responses are either stateful or stateless responses. Stateful responses are configured to undo the action after a specified period of time while stateless responses are configured as one-time actions.

Where are active response actions executed?

Each active response specifies where its associated command will be executed: on the agent that triggered the alert, on the manager, on another specified agent or on all agents, which also includes the manager(s).

Active response configuration
Active responses are configured in the manager by modifying the ossec.conf file as follows:
1. Create a command
- In order to configure an active response, a command must be defined that will initiate a certain script in response to a trigger.
- To configure the active response, define the name of a command using the pattern below and then reference the script to be initiated. Next, define what data element(s) will be passed to the script.
- Custom scripts that have the ability to receive parameters from the command line may also be used for an active response.

Example:
```xml
<command>
  <name>host-deny</name>
  <executable>host-deny.sh</executable>
  <expect>srcip</expect>
  <timeout_allowed>yes</timeout_allowed>
</command>
```
In this example, the command is called host-deny and initiates the host-deny.sh script. The data element is defined as srcip. This command is configured to allow a timeout after a specified period of time, making it a stateful response.

2. Define the active response
The active response configuration defines when and where a command is going to be executed. A command will be triggered when a specific rule with a specific id, severity level or source matches the active response criteria. This configuration will further define where the action of the command will be initiated, meaning in which environment (agent, manager, local, or everywhere).

Example:
```xml
<active-response>
  <command>host-deny</command>
  <location>local</location>
  <level>7</level>
  <timeout>600</timeout>
</active-response>
```
In this example, the active response is configured to execute the command that was defined in the previous step. The where of the action is defined as the local host and the when is defined as any time the rule has a level higher than 6. The timeout that was allowed in the command configuration is also defined in the above example.
The active response log can be viewed at ```/var/ossec/logs/active-responses.log```

#### Configuration

Basic usage.
An active response is configured in the ```ossec.conf``` file in the ```Active Response``` and ```Command sections```.
In this example, the ```restart-ossec``` command is configured to use the ```restart-ossec.sh``` script with no data element. The active response is configured to initiate the ```restart-ossec``` command on the local host when the rule with ID 10005 fires. This is a Stateless response as no timeout parameter is defined.

Command:
```xml
<command>
  <name>restart-ossec</name>
  <executable>restart-ossec.sh</executable>
  <expect></expect>
</command>
```

Active response:
```xml
<active-response>
  <command>restart-ossec</command>
  <location>local</location>
  <rules_id>10005</rules_id>
</active-response>
```

Windows automatic remediation.
In this example, the ```win_rout-null``` command is configured to use the ```route-null.cmd``` script using the data element ```srcip```. The active response is configured to initiate the ```win_rout-null``` command on the local host when the rule has a higher alert level than 7. This is a Stateful response with a timeout set at 900 seconds.

Command:
```xml
<command>
  <name>win_route-null</name>
  <executable>route-null.cmd</executable>
  <expect>srcip</expect>
  <timeout_allowed>yes</timeout_allowed>
</command>
```

Active response:
```xml
<active-response>
  <command>win_route-null</command>
  <location>local</location>
  <level>8</level>
  <timeout>900</timeout>
</active-response>
```

Block an IP with PF.
In this example, the ```pf-block``` command is configured to use the ```pf.sh``` script using the data element ```srcip```. The active response is configured to initiate the ```pf-block``` command on agent 001 when a rule in either the "authentication_failed" or "authentication_failures" rule group fires. This is a Stateless response as no timeout parameter is defined.

Command:
```xml
<command>
  <name>pf-block</name>
  <executable>pf.sh</executable>
  <expect>srcip</expect>
</command>
```

Active response:
```xml
<active-response>
  <command>pf-block</command>
  <location>defined-agent</location>
  <agent_id>001</agent_id>
  <rules_group>authentication_failed|authentication_failures</rules_group>
</active-response>
```

Add an IP to the iptables deny list.
In this example, the ```firewall-drop``` command is configured to use the ```firewall-drop.sh``` script using the data element ```srcip```. The active response is configured to initiate the ```firewall-drop``` command on all systems when a rule in either the "authentication_failed" or "authentication_failures" rule group fires. This is a Stateful response with a timeout of 700 seconds. The ```<repeated_offenders>``` tag increases the timeout period for each subsequent offense by a specific IP address.

Command:
```xml
<command>
  <name>firewall-drop</command>
  <executable>firewall-drop.sh</executable>
  <expect>srcip</expect>
</command>
```

Active response:
```xml
<active-response>
  <command>firewall-drop</command>
  <location>all</location>
  <rules_group>authentication_failed|authentication_failures</rules_group>
  <timeout>700</timeout>
  <repeated_offenders>30,60,120</repeated_offenders>
</active-response>
```

Active response for a specified period of time .
The action of a stateful response continues for a specified period of time.

In this example, the ```host-deny``` command is configured to use the ```host-deny.sh``` script using the data element ```srcip```. The active response is configured to initiate the ```host-deny``` command on the local host when a rule with a higher alert level than 6 is fired.

Command:
```xml
<command>
  <name>host-deny</name>
  <executable>host-deny.sh</executable>
  <expect>srcip</expect>
  <timeout_allowed>yes</timeout_allowed>
</command>
```

Active response:
```xml
<active-response>
  <command>host-deny</command>
  <location>local</location>
  <level>7</level>
  <timeout>600</timeout>
</active-response>
```

Active response that will not be undone.
The action of a stateless command is a one-time action that will not be undone.

In this example, the ```mail-test``` command is configured to use the ```mail-test.sh``` script with no data element. The active response is configured to initiate the ```mail-test``` command on the server when the rule with ID 1002 fires.

Command:
```xml
<command>
  <name>mail-test</name>
  <executable>mail-test.sh</executable>
  <timeout_allowed>no</timeout_allowed>
  <expect></expect>
</command>
```

Active response:
```xml
<active-response>
    <command>mail-test</command>
    <location>server</location>
    <rules_id>1002</rules_id>
 </active-response>
```

### Vulnerability detection

#### How it works

To be able to detect vulnerabilities, now agents are able to natively collect a list of installed applications, sending it periodically to the manager (where it is stored in local sqlite databases, one per agent). Also, the manager builds a global vulnerabilities database, from publicly available CVE repositories, using it later to cross-correlate this information with the agent's applications inventory data.

The global vulnerabilities database is created automatically, currently pulling data from the following repositories:
- https://canonical.com: Used to pull CVEs for Ubuntu Linux distributions.
- https://access.redhat.com: Used to pull CVEs for Red Hat and CentOS Linux distributions.
- https://www.debian.org: Used to pull CVEs for Debian Linux distributions.
- https://nvd.nist.gov/: Used to pull CVEs from the National Vulnerability Database.

This database can be configured to be updated periodically, ensuring that the solution will check for the very latest CVEs.

Once the global vulnerability database (with the CVEs) is created, the detection process looks for vulnerable packages in the inventory databases (unique per agent). Alerts are generated when a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) affects a package that is known to be installed in one of the monitored servers. A package is labeled as vulnerable when its version is contained within the affected range of a CVE.

#### Running a vulnerability scan

1. Enable the agent module used to collect installed packages on the monitored system.
It can be done by adding the following block of settings to your shared agent configuration file:

```xml
<wodle name="syscollector">
  <disabled>no</disabled>
  <interval>1h</interval>
  <os>yes</os>
  <packages>yes</packages>
</wodle>
```

If you want to scan vulnerabilities in Windows agents, you will also have to add the ```hotfixes``` scan:

```xml
<wodle name="syscollector">
  <disabled>no</disabled>
  <interval>1h</interval>
  <os>yes</os>
  <packages>yes</packages>
  <hotfixes>yes</hotfixes>
</wodle>
```

2. Enable the manager module used to detect vulnerabilities.
You can do this adding a block like the following to your manager configuration file:

```xml
<vulnerability-detector>
    <enabled>yes</enabled>
    <interval>5m</interval>
    <ignore_time>6h</ignore_time>
    <run_on_start>yes</run_on_start>

    <provider name="canonical">
        <enabled>yes</enabled>
        <os>trusty</os>
        <os>xenial</os>
        <os>bionic</os>
        <os>focal</os>
        <update_interval>1h</update_interval>
    </provider>

    <provider name="debian">
        <enabled>yes</enabled>
        <os>wheezy</os>
        <os>stretch</os>
        <os>jessie</os>
        <os>buster</os>
        <update_interval>1h</update_interval>
    </provider>

    <provider name="redhat">
        <enabled>yes</enabled>
        <update_from_year>2010</update_from_year>
        <update_interval>1h</update_interval>
    </provider>

    <provider name="nvd">
        <enabled>yes</enabled>
        <update_from_year>2010</update_from_year>
        <update_interval>1h</update_interval>
    </provider>

</vulnerability-detector>
```

Remember to restart the manager to apply the changes.

You can also check the vulnerability dashboards to have an overview of your agents' status.

## UEBA

ITRS Log Analytics system allows building and maintaining user's database model (UBA) and computers (EBA), and uses build in mechanisms of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Both have been implemented withing UEBA module.

The UEBA module enables premium features of ITRS Log Analytics SIEM Plan. This is module which collects knowledge and functionalities which were always available in our system. This cybersecurity approach helps analytics to discover threads in user and entities behaviour. Module tracks user or resource actions and scans common behaviour patterns. With UEBA system provides deep knowledge of daily trends in actions enabling SOC teams to detect any abnormal and suspicious activities. UEBA differs a lot from regular SIEM approach based on logs analytics in time.

The module focus on actions and not the logs itself. Every user, host or other resource is identified as an entity in the system and its behaviour describes its work. ITRS Log Analytics provide new data schema that mark each action over time. Underlying Energy search engine analyse incoming data in order to identify log corresponding to action. We leave the log for SIEM use cases, but incoming data is associated with an action categories. New data model stores actions for each entity and mark them down as metadata stored in individual index.

Once tracking is done, SOC teams can investigate patterns for single action among many entities or many actions for a single user/entity. This unique approach creates an activity map for everyone working in the organization and for any resource. Created dataset is stored in time. All actions can be analysed for understanding the trend and comparing it with historical profile. UEBA is designed to give information about the common type of action that user or entity performs and allows to identify specific time slots for each. Any differences noted, abnormal occurances of an event can be a subject of automatic alerts. UEBA comes with defined dashboards which shows discovered actions and metrics for them.

It is easy to filter presented data with single username/host or a group of users/hosts using query syntax. With help of saved searches SOC can create own outlook to stay focused on users at high risk of an attack.
ITRS Log Analytics is made for working with data. UEBA gives new analytics approach, but what is more important it brings new metrics that we can work with. Artificial Intelligence functionality build in ITRS Log Analytics help to calculate forecast for each action over single user or entire organization. In the same time thanks to extended set of rule types, ITRS Log Analytics can correlate behavioral analysis with other data collected from environment. Working with ITRS Log Analytics SIEM Plan with UEBA module greatly enlarge security analytics scope.

## BCM Remedy

ITRS Log Analytics creates incidents that require handling based on notifications from the Alert module. This can be done, for example, in the BMC Remedy system using API requests. 

BMC Remedy configuration details: [https://docs.bmc.com/docs/ars91/en/bmc-remedy-ar-system-rest-api-overview-609071509.html](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/ars91/en/bmc-remedy-ar-system-rest-api-overview-609071509.html) .

To perform this incident notification in an external system.  You need to select in the configuration of the alert rule "Alert Method" "Command" and in the "Path to script/command" field enter the correct request.

![](/media/media/image239.png)

It is possible to close the incident in the external system using a parameter added to the alert rule.

```yaml
  #Recovery definition:
  recovery: true
  recovery_command: "mail -s 'Recovery Alert for rule RULE_NAME' user@example.com < /dev/null"
```

## SIEM Virtus Total integration

This integration utilizes the VirusTotal API to detect malicious content within the files monitored by **File Integrity Monitoring**. This integration functions as described below:

1. FIM looks for any file addition, change, or deletion onthe monitored folders. This module stores the hash of thesefiles and triggers alerts when any changes are made.
2. When the VirusTotal integration is enabled, it istriggered when an FIM alert occurs. From this alert, themodule extracts the hash field of the file.
3. The module then makes an HTTP POST request to theVirusTotal database using the VirusTotal API for comparisonbetween the extracted hash and the information contained inthe database.
4. A JSON response is then received that is the result ofthis search which will trigger one of the following alerts:
    - Error: Public API request rate limit reached.
    - Error: Check credentials.
    - Alert: No records in VirusTotal database.
    - Alert: No positives found.
    - Alert: X engines detected this file.

The triggered alert is logged in the ``integration.log`` file and stored in the ``alerts.log`` file with all other alerts.

Find examples of these alerts in the `VirusTotal integrationalerts`_ section below.

### Configuration

  Follow the instructions from :ref:`manual_integration` to enable the **Integrator** daemon and configure the VirusTotal integration.

  This is an example configuration to add on the ``ossec.conf`` file:

```xml
  <integration>
    <name>virustotal</name>
    <api_key>API_KEY</api_key> <!-- Replace with your   sTotal API key -->
    <group>syscheck</group>
    <alert_format>json</alert_format>
  </integration>
```

## SIEM Custom integration

The integrator tool is able to connect SIEM module with other external software. 

This is an example configuration for a custom integration in `ossec.conf`:

```xml
  <!--Custom external Integration -->
  <integration>
    <name>custom-integration</name>
    <hook_url>WEBHOOK</hook_url>
    <level>10</level>
    <group>multiple_drops|authentication_failures</group>
    <api_key>APIKEY</api_key> <!-- Replace with your external service API key -->
    <alert_format>json</alert_format>
  </integration>
```

To start the custom integration, the `ossec.conf` file, including the block integration component, has to be modified in the manager. The following parameters can be used:

 - name: Name of the script that performs the integration. In the case of a custom integration like the one discussed in this article, the name must start with “custom-“.
 - hook_url: URL provided by the software API to connect to the API itself. Its use is optional, since it can be included in the script.
 - api_key: Key of the API that enables us to use it. Its use is also optional for the same reason the use of the hook_url is optional.
 - level: Sets a level filter so that the script will not receive alerts below a certain level.
 - rule_id: Sets a filter for alert identifiers.
 - group: Sets an alert group filter.
 - event_location: Sets an alert source filter.
 - alert_format: Indicates that the script receives the alerts in JSON format (recommended). By default, the script will receive the alerts in full_log format.

## License Service

License service configuration is required when using the SIEM Plan license. To configure the License Service, set the following parameters in the configuration file:


hosts - Elasticsearch cluster hosts IP,
password - password for Logserver  user,
https - true or false.

```bash
vi /opt/license-service/license-service.conf
```

```bash
elasticsearch_connection:
  hosts: ["els_host_IP:9200"]

  username: logserver
  password: "logserver_password"

  https: true
```

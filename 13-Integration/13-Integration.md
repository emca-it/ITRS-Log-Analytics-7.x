# Integrations

## OP5 - Naemon logs ##

### Logstash ###

1. In `naemon_beat.conf` set up `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`, `ES_PORT`, `FILEBEAT_PORT`

2. Copy `naemon_beat.conf` to `/etc/logstash/conf.d`

3. Based on "FILEBEAT_PORT" if firewall is running:

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=FILEBEAT_PORT/tcp
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

   

4. Based on amount of data that elasticsearch will receive you can also choose whether you want index creation to be based on moths or days:

   ```bash
   index => "op5-naemon-%{+YYYY.MM}"
   or
   index => "op5-naemon-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
   ```

   

5. Copy `naemon` file to `/etc/logstash/patterns` and make sure it is readable by logstash process
5. Restart *logstash* configuration e.g.:

   ```bash
   sudo systemct restart logstash
   ```

   

   ### Elasticsearch
1. Connect to Elasticsearch node via SSH and Install index pattern for naemon logs. Note that if you have a default pattern covering *settings* section you should delete/modify that in naemon_template.sh:

   ```bash
   "settings": {
       "number_of_shards": 5,
       "auto_expand_replicas": "0-1"
     },
   ```

   

2. Install template by running:
   `./naemon_template.sh`
### OP5 Monitor ###

1. On OP5 Monitor host install filebeat (for instance via rpm `https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat`)
1. In `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml` add:

		#=========================== Filebeat inputs =============================
		filebeat.config.inputs:
		  enabled: true
		  path: configs/*.yml

1. You also will have to configure the output section in `filebeat.yml`. You should have one logstash output:

		#----------------------------- Logstash output --------------------------------
		output.logstash:
		  # The Logstash hosts
		  hosts: ["LOGSTASH_IP:FILEBEAT_PORT"]

	If you have few logstash instances - `Logstash` section has to be repeated on every node and `hosts:` should point to all of them:

		hosts: ["LOGSTASH_IP:FILEBEAT_PORT", "LOGSTASH_IP:FILEBEAT_PORT", "LOGSTASH_IP:FILEBEAT_PORT" ]

1. Create `/etc/filebeat/configs` catalog.
1. Copy `naemon_logs.yml` to a newly created catalog.
1. Check the newly added configuration and connection to logstash. Location of executable might vary based on os:

		/usr/share/filebeat/bin/filebeat --path.config /etc/filebeat/ test config
		/usr/share/filebeat/bin/filebeat --path.config /etc/filebeat/ test output

1. Restart filebeat:

		sudo systemctl restart filebeat # RHEL/CentOS 7
		sudo service filebeat restart # RHEL/CentOS 6

### Elasticsearch ###

At this moment there should be a new index on the Elasticsearch node:

	curl -XGET '127.0.0.1:9200/_cat/indices?v'

Example output:

		health status index                 uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
		green  open   op5-naemon-2018.11    gO8XRsHiTNm63nI_RVCy8w   1   0      23176            0      8.3mb          8.3mb

If the index has been created, in order to browse and visualise the data, "index pattern" needs to be added in Kibana.

## OP5 - Performance data ##

Below instruction requires that between ITRS Log Analytics node and Elasticsearch node is working Logstash instance.

### Elasticsearch ###
1.	First, settings section in *template.sh* should be adjusted, either:
	- there is a default template present on Elasticsearch that already covers shards and replicas then settings sections should be removed from the *template.sh* before executing
	- there is no default template - shards and replicas should be adjusted for you environment (keep in mind replicas can be added later, while changing shards count on existing index requires 
		reindexing it)

			"settings": {
			  "number_of_shards": 5,
			  "number_of_replicas": 0
			}

1. In URL *op5-perfdata* is a name for the template - later it can be search for or modify with it.

1. The "*template*" is an index pattern. New indices matching it will have the settings and mapping applied automatically (change it if you index name for *ITRS Log Analytics perfdata* is different).

1. Mapping name should match documents type:

    ```
    "mappings": {
    	  "op5-perflogs"
    ```

    Running template.sh will create a template (not index) for ITRS Log Analytics perf data documents.

### Logstash ###

1.	The *perflogs.conf* contains example of *input/filter/output* configuration. It has to be copied to */etc/logstash/conf.d/*. Make sure that the *logstash* has permissions to read the configuration files:
	
	```bash
	chmod 664 /etc/logstash/conf.d/op5/perflogs.conf
	```
	
	
	
2. In the input section comment/uncomment *“beats”* or *“tcp”* depending on preference (beats if *Filebeat* will be used and tcp if *NetCat*). The port and the type has to be adjusted as well:

   ```bash
   port => PORT_NUMBER
   type => "op5-perflogs"
   ```

   

3. In a filter section type has to be changed if needed to match the input section and Elasticsearch mapping.

4. In an output section type should match with the rest of a *config*. host should point to your elasticsearch node. index name should correspond with what has been set in elasticsearch template to allow mapping application. The date for index rotation in its name is recommended and depending on the amount of data expecting to be transferred should be set to daily (+YYYY.MM.dd) or monthly (+YYYY.MM) rotation:

   ```bash
   hosts => ["127.0.0.1:9200"]
   index => "op5-perflogs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
   ```

5. Port has to be opened on a firewall:

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=PORT_NUMBER/tcp
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

6. Logstash has to be reloaded:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart logstash
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   sudo kill -1 LOGSTASH_PID
   ```

### op5 Monitor ###

1. You have to decide wether FileBeat or NetCat will be used. In case of Filebeat - skip to the second step. Otherwise:

   - Comment line:

     ```bash
     54    open(my $logFileHandler, '>>', $hostPerfLogs) or die "Could not open $hostPerfLogs"; #FileBeat
     •	Uncomment lines:
     55 #    open(my $logFileHandler, '>', $hostPerfLogs) or die "Could not open $hostPerfLogs"; #NetCat
     ...
     88 #    my $logstashIP = "LOGSTASH_IP";
     89 #    my $logstashPORT = "LOGSTASH_PORT";
     90 #    if (-e $hostPerfLogs) {
     91 #        my $pid1 = fork();
     92 #        if ($pid1 == 0) {
     93 #            exec("/bin/cat $hostPerfLogs | /usr/bin/nc -w 30 $logstashIP $logstashPORT");
     94 #        }
     95 #    }
     ```

     

   - In process-service-perfdata-log.pl and process-host-perfdata-log.pl: change logstash IP and port:

     ```bash
     92 my $logstashIP = "LOGSTASH_IP";
     93 my $logstashPORT = "LOGSTASH_PORT";
     ```
     
     

2. In case of running single ITRS Log Analytics node, there is no problem with the setup. In case of a peered environment *$do_on_host* variable has to be set up and the script *process-service-perfdata-log.pl/process-host-perfdata-log.pl* has to be propagated on all of ITRS Log Analytics nodes:

   ```bash
   16 $do_on_host = "EXAMPLE_HOSTNAME"; # ITRS Log Analytics node name to run the script on
   17 $hostName = hostname; # will read hostname of a node running the script
   ```

   

3. Example of command definition (*/opt/monitor/etc/checkcommands.cfg*) if scripts have been copied to */opt/plugins/custom/*:

   ```bash
   # command 'process-service-perfdata-log'
   define command{
       command_name                   process-service-perfdata-log
       command_line                   /opt/plugins/custom/process-service-perfdata-log.pl $TIMET$
       }
   # command 'process-host-perfdata-log'
   define command{
       command_name                   process-host-perfdata-log
       command_line                   /opt/plugins/custom/process-host-perfdata-log.pl $TIMET$
       }
   ```

   

4. In */opt/monitor/etc/naemon.cfg service_perfdata_file_processing_command* and *host_perfdata_file_processing_command* has to be changed to run those custom scripts:

   ```bash
   service_perfdata_file_processing_command=process-service-perfdata-log
   host_perfdata_file_processing_command=process-host-perfdata-log
   ```

   

5. In addition *service_perfdata_file_template* and *host_perfdata_file_template* can be changed to support sending more data to Elasticsearch. For instance, by adding *$HOSTGROUPNAMES$* and *$SERVICEGROUPNAMES$* macros logs can be separated better (it requires changes to Logstash filter config as well)

5. Restart naemon service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart naemon # CentOS/RHEL 7.x
   sudo service naemon restart # CentOS/RHEL 7.x
   ```

   

6. If *FileBeat* has been chosen, append below to *filebeat.conf* (adjust IP and PORT):

   ```bash
   filebeat.inputs:
   type: log
   enabled: true
   paths:
     - /opt/monitor/var/service_performance.log
     - /opt/monitor/var/host_performance.log
   tags: ["ITRS Log Analyticsperflogs"]
     output.logstash:
   # The Logstash hosts
     hosts: ["LOGSTASH_IP:LOGSTASH_PORT"]
   ```

   

7. Restart FileBeat service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart filebeat # CentOS/RHEL 7.x
   sudo service filebeat restart # CentOS/RHEL 7.x
   ```

   

   ### Kibana

At this moment there should be new index on the Elasticsearch node with performance data documents from OP5 Monitor. 
Login to an Elasticsearch node and run: `curl -XGET '127.0.0.1:9200/_cat/indices?v'` Example output:

	health status index                      pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
	green  open   auth                       5   0          7         6230      1.8mb          1.8mb
	green  open   ITRS Log Analytics-perflogs-2018.09.14    5   0      72109            0     24.7mb         24.7mb

After a while, if there is no new index make sure that: 

- Naemon is runnig on ITRS Log Analytics node
- Logstash service is running and there are no errors in: */var/log/logstash/logstash-plain.log* 
- Elasticsearch service is running an there are no errors in: */var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log*

If the index has been created, in order to browse and visualize the data “*index pattern*” needs to be added to Kibana. 

1. After logging in to Kibana GUI go to *Settings* tab and add *ITRS Log Analytics-perflogs-** pattern. Chose *@timestamp* time field and click *Create*. 
2. Performance data logs should be now accessible from Kibana GUI Discovery tab ready to be visualize.

        [root@localhost ~]#
     ```

     

2. To connect the Grafana application you should:

   - define the default login/password (line 151;154 in config file):

     ```bash
     [root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/grafana/grafana.ini
     148 #################################### Security ####################################
     149 [security]
     150 # default admin user, created on startup
     151 admin_user = admin
     152
     153 # default admin password, can be changed before first start of grafana,  or in profile settings
     154 admin_password = admin
     155
     ```

     

   - restart *grafana-server* service:

     ```bash
     systemctl restart grafana-server
     ```

     

   - Login to Grafana user interface using web browser: *http://ip:3000*

     ![](/media/media/image112.png)

   - use login and password that you set in the config file.

   - Use below example to set conection to Elasticsearch server:

     ![](/media/media/image113.png)

## The Beats configuration ##

### Kibana API ###

Reference link: [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/api.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/api.html "https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/api.html")

After installing any of beats package you can use ready to use dashboard related to this beat package. For instance dashboard and index pattern are available in */usr/share/filebeat/kibana/6/* directory on Linux.

Before uploading index-pattern or dashboard you have to authorize yourself: 

1. Set up *login/password/kibana_ip* variables, e.g.:

		login=my_user
		password=my_password
		kibana_ip=10.4.11.243

1. Execute command which will save authorization cookie:

		curl -c authorization.txt -XPOST -k "https://${kibana_ip}:5601/login" -d "username=${username}&password=${password}&version=6.2.3&location=https%3A%2F%2F${kibana_ip}%3A5601%2Flogin"

1.	Upload index-pattern and dashboard to *Kibana*, e.g.:

		curl -b authorization.txt -XPOST -k "https://${kibana_ip}:5601/api/kibana/dashboards/import" -H 'kbn-xsrf: true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d@/usr/share/filebeat/kibana/6/index-pattern/filebeat.json
		curl -b authorization.txt -XPOST -k "https://${kibana_ip}:5601/api/kibana/dashboards/import" -H 'kbn-xsrf: true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d@/usr/share/filebeat/kibana/6/dashboard/Filebeat-mysql.json

1.	When you want to upload beats index template to Ealsticsearch you have to recover it first (usually you do not send logs directly to Es rather than to Logstash first):

		/usr/bin/filebeat export template --es.version 6.2.3 >> /path/to/beats_template.json

1.	After that you can upload it as any other template (Access Es node with SSH):

		curl -XPUT "localhost:9200/_template/ITRS Log Analyticsperfdata" -H'Content-Type: application/json' -d@beats_template.json

## Wazuh integration ##

ITRS Log Analytics can integrate with the Wazuh, which is lightweight agent is designed to perform a number of tasks with the objective of detecting threats and, when necessary, trigger automatic responses. The agent core capabilities are:

- Log and events data collection
- File and registry keys integrity monitoring
- Inventory of running processes and installed applications
- Monitoring of open ports and network configuration
- Detection of rootkits or malware artifacts
- Configuration assessment and policy monitoring
- Execution of active responses

The Wazuh agents run on many different platforms, including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, AIX, Solaris and HP-UX. They can be configured and managed from the Wazuh server.

## 2FA authorization with Google Auth Provider (example)

### Software used (tested versions):

- NGiNX (1.16.1 - from CentOS base reposiory)
- oauth2_proxy ([https://github.com/pusher/oauth2_proxy/releases](https://github.com/pusher/oauth2_proxy/releases) - 4.0.0)

### The NGiNX configuration:

1. Copy the [ng_oauth2_proxy.conf](/files/ng_oauth2_proxy.conf) to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`;

   ```bash
   server {
       listen 443 default ssl;
       server_name logserver.local;
       ssl_certificate /etc/kibana/ssl/logserver.org.crt;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/kibana/ssl/logserver.org.key;
       ssl_session_cache   builtin:1000  shared:SSL:10m;
       add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=2592000;
   
     location /oauth2/ {
       proxy_pass       http://127.0.0.1:4180;
       proxy_set_header Host                    $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP               $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Scheme                $scheme;
       proxy_set_header X-Auth-Request-Redirect $request_uri;
       # or, if you are handling multiple domains:
       # proxy_set_header X-Auth-Request-Redirect $scheme://$host$request_uri;
     }
     location = /oauth2/auth {
       proxy_pass       http://127.0.0.1:4180;
       proxy_set_header Host             $host;
       proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
       proxy_set_header X-Scheme         $scheme;
       # nginx auth_request includes headers but not body
       proxy_set_header Content-Length   "";
       proxy_pass_request_body           off;
     }
   
     location / {
       auth_request /oauth2/auth;
       error_page 401 = /oauth2/sign_in;
   
       # pass information via X-User and X-Email headers to backend,
       # requires running with --set-xauthrequest flag
       auth_request_set $user   $upstream_http_x_auth_request_user;
       auth_request_set $email  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_email;
       proxy_set_header X-User  $user;
       proxy_set_header X-Email $email;
   
       # if you enabled --pass-access-token, this will pass the token to the backend
       auth_request_set $token  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_access_token;
       proxy_set_header X-Access-Token $token;
   
       # if you enabled --cookie-refresh, this is needed for it to work with auth_request
       auth_request_set $auth_cookie $upstream_http_set_cookie;
       add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie;
   
       # When using the --set-authorization-header flag, some provider's cookies can exceed the 4kb
       # limit and so the OAuth2 Proxy splits these into multiple parts.
       # Nginx normally only copies the first `Set-Cookie` header from the auth_request to the response,
       # so if your cookies are larger than 4kb, you will need to extract additional cookies manually.
       auth_request_set $auth_cookie_name_upstream_1 $upstream_cookie_auth_cookie_name_1;
   
       # Extract the Cookie attributes from the first Set-Cookie header and append them
       # to the second part ($upstream_cookie_* variables only contain the raw cookie content)
       if ($auth_cookie ~* "(; .*)") {
           set $auth_cookie_name_0 $auth_cookie;
           set $auth_cookie_name_1 "auth_cookie__oauth2_proxy_1=$auth_cookie_name_upstream_1$1";
       }
   
       # Send both Set-Cookie headers now if there was a second part
       if ($auth_cookie_name_upstream_1) {
           add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie_name_0;
           add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie_name_1;
       }
   
       proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:5601;
       # or "root /path/to/site;" or "fastcgi_pass ..." etc
     }
   }
   ```


1. Set `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` path in ng_oauth2_proxy.conf

When SSL is set using nginx proxy, Kibana can be started with http. 
However, if it is to be run with encryption, you also need to change `proxy_pass` to the appropriate one.

### The oauth2 proxy configuration:

1. Copy the [oauth2_proxy.cfg](/files/oauth2_proxy.cfg);

## 2FA with Nginx and PKI certificate

### Seting up Nginx Client-Certificate for Kibana

#### 1. Installing NGINX

   The following [link](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/) directs you to the official NGINX documentation with installation instructions.

#### 2. Creating client-certificate signing CA
   
   Now, we'll create our client-certificate signing CA. Let's create a directoru at thr root file system to pertform this work.
   ```
   cd /etc/nginx
   mkdir CertificateAuthCA
   cd CertificateAuthCA
   chown root:www-data /etc/nginx/CertificateAuthCA/
   chmod 770 /etc/nginx/CertificateAuthCA/
   ```
   
   This set of permissions will grant the user **root** (replace with the username of your own privileged user used to setup the box) and the **www-data** group (the context in which nginx runs by default). It will grant everyone else no permission to the sensitive file that is your **root** signing key. 
  
   You will be prompted to set a passphrase. Make sure to set it to something yuo'll remember. 

   ```
   openssl genrsa -des3 -out myca.key 4096
   ```

   Makes the signing CA valid for 10 years. Change as requirements dictate. You will be asked to fill in attributes fo your CA. 

   ```
   openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key myca.key -out myca.crt
   ```

#### 3. Creating a client keypair
   
   This will be performed once for **EACH user**. It can easily be scripted as part of a user provisioning process. 

   You will be prompted for passphrase which will be distributed to your user with the certificate. 
   
   **NOTE** \
   <mark>DO NOT ever distributed the passphrase set above for your root CA's private key.</mark> \
   <mark>Make sure you understand this distinction!</mark>
   
   ```
   openssl genrsa -des3 -out testuser.key 2048
   openssl req -new -key testuser.key -out testuser.csr
   ```

   Sign with our certificate-signing CA. This Certificate will be valid for one year. Change as per your requirements. You can increment the serial if you have t oreissue the CERT. 
      
   ```
   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in testuser.csr -CA myca.crt -CAkey myca.key -set_serial 01 -out testuser.crt
   ```
   
   For Windows clients, the key material can be combined into a single PFX. You will be prompted fo the passpharase you set above. 
   
   ```
   openssl pkcs12 -export -out testuser.pfx -inkey testuser.key -in testuser.crt -certfile myca.crt
   ```
   
   This includes the public portion of your CA's key to allows Windows to trust you internally signed CA. 

#### 4. Creating the nginx configuration file

   Here, we'll create the nginx configuration file to serve a site for our authenticated reverse proxy. 
   
   Creating site certificates (The ones that will be publicly signed by a CA such as from SSLTrust). 
   
   ```
   chown -R root:www-data /etc/nginx/CertificateAuthCA
   chmod 700 /etc/nginx/CertificateAuthCA
   ```
   
   Generate an RSA Private Key (You will be prompted to a passphrase and fill out attributes). 
   
   ```
   openssl genrsa -out ./domain.com.key 2048
   ```
   
   Use it to create a CSR to send us. 
   
   ```
   openssl req -new -sha256 -key ./domain.com.key -out ./domain.com.csr
   ```
   
   Creating CERT for **domain.com**  
   
   ```
   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in domain.com.csr -CA myca.crt -CAkey myca.key -set_serial 01 -out domain.com.crt
   ```
   
   Remove the passphrase from your key (you will be prompted for passphrase generated abov).
   
   ```
   openssl rsa -in domain.com.key -out domain.com.key.nopass
   ```
   
   Create nginx sites-available directory. 
   
   ```
   cd /etc/nginx
   mkdir sites-available
   cd sites-available
   ```
   
   And create a new configuration file(we use vim, you could use nano or other fav text editor). 
   
   ```
   touch proxy.conf
   vim proxy.conf
   ```

#### 5. Setting configurations in configuration file paste
   
   Before you set configurations make sure that you have installed and enabled [firewalld](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/introduction-to-firewalld-on-centos/). 
   
   In configuration file(proxy.conf):
   
   ```
   server {
       listen        443;  ## REMEMBER ! Listen port and firewall port must match !!
       ssl on;
       server_name 192.168.3.87;  ## Set up your IP as server_name
       proxy_ssl_server_name on;
       ssl_certificate      /etc/nginx/CertificateAuthCA/domain.com.crt; ## Use your domain key
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/CertificateAuthCA/domain.com.key.nopass; ## Use your own trusted certificate without password
       ssl_client_certificate /etc/nginx/CertificateAuthCA/myca.key; ## Use your own trusted certificate from CA/SSLTrust
   
       ssl_verify_client on;
   
       ## You can optionally capture the error code and redirect it to a custom page
       ## error_page 495 496 497 https://someerrorpage.yourdomain.com;
   
       ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
       ssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
       ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:kEDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-RC4-SHA:RC4-SHA:HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!3DES:!MD5:!PSK';
   
       keepalive_timeout 10;
       ssl_session_timeout 5m;
   
   location / {
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
       proxy_redirect off;
       proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
       proxy_pass http://localhost:5601/;   ##proxy_pass for Kibana
   
     }
   }
   ```
   
#### 6. Create a symlink to enable your site in nginx
   
   In the nginx directory is **nginx.conf** file in which we will load modular configuration files (**include**). \
   Based on <b>/etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf</b>; create symlink using **proxy.conf**.
   
   ```
   cd /etc/nginx
   ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/proxy.conf
   ```
   
#### 7. Restart nginx
   
   ```
   systemctl restart nginx
   ```
   
#### 8. Importing the Client Certificate on to a Windows Machine
   
   Double click the .PFX file, select "Current User". \
   ![](/media/media/11_2fa_nginx_pki_01.png) 
   ![](/media/media/11_2fa_nginx_pki_02.png)
   
   If you set a passphrase on the PFX above, enter it here. Otherwise leave blank and hit next. \
   ![](/media/media/11_2fa_nginx_pki_03.png)
   
   Next, add the site in question to "trusted sites" in Internet Explorer. This will allow the client certificate to be sent to the site for verification(Trusting it in Internet Explorer will trust it in chrome as well). 
   
   When you next visite the site, you should be prompted to select a client certificate. Select "OK" and you're in \
   ![](/media/media/11_2fa_nginx_pki_04.png)



## Embedding dashboard in iframe

It is possible to send alerts containing HTML *iframe* as notification content. For example:

```html
<a href="https://siem-vip:5601/app/kibana#/discover/72503360-1b25-11ea-bbe4-d7be84731d2c?_g=%28refreshInterval%3A%28display%3AOff%2Csection%3A0%2Cvalue%3A0%29%2Ctime%3A%28from%3A%272021-03-03T08%3A36%3A50Z%27%2Cmode%3Aabsolute%2Cto%3A%272021-03-04T08%3A36%3A50Z%27%29%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://siem-vip:5601/app/kibana#/discover/72503360-1b25-11ea-bbe4-d7be84731d2c?_g=%28refreshInterval%3A%28display%3AOff%2Csection%3A0%2Cvalue%3A0%29%2Ctime%3A%28from%3A%272021-03-03T08%3A36%3A50Z%27%2Cmode%3Aabsolute%2Cto%3A%272021-03-04T08%3A36%3A50Z%27%29%29</a>
```

If you want an existing HTTP session to be used to display the iframe content, you need to set the following parameters in the `/etc/kibana/kibana.yml` file:

```yaml
login.isSameSite: "Lax"
login.isSecure: true
```

Possible values for *isSameSite* are: **"None", "Lax", "Strict", false**

For *isSecure*: **false or true**

## Integration with AWS service

### The scope of integration

The integration of ITRS Log Analytics with the AWS cloud environment was prepared based on the following requirements:

1. General information of the EC2 area, i.e .:
   - number of machines
   - number of CPUs
   - amount of RAM
2. General information of the RDS area, i.e.:
   - Number of RDS instances
   - The number of RDS CPUs
   - Amount of RDS RAM
3. EC2 area information containing information for each machine i.e .:
   - list of tags;
   - cloudwatch alarms configured;
   - basic information (e.g. imageID, reservtionid, accountid, launch date, private and public address, last backup, etc.);
   - list of available metrics in cloudwatch;
   - list of snapshots;
   - AMI list;
   - cloudtrail (all records, with detailed details).
4. Information on Backups of EC2 and RDS instances
5. Search for S3 objects, shoes, AMI images
6. Downloading additional information about other resources, ie IG, NAT Gateway, Transit Gateway.
7. Monitoring changes in the infrastructure based on Cloudtrail logs;
8. Monitoring costs based on billing and usage reports.
9. Monitoring the Security Group and resources connected to them and resources not connected to the Security Group
10. Monitoring user activity and inactivity.
11. Integration supports service for multiple member accounts in AWS organization

The integration uses a Data Collector, i.e. the ITRS Log Analytics host, which is responsible for receiving data from external sources.

### Data download mechanism

The integration was prepared based on AWS (CLI), a unified tool for managing AWS services, with which it is possible to download and monitor many AWS services from the command line. The AWS (CLI) tool is controlled by the ITRS Log Analytics data collector, which execute commands at specified intervals and captures the results of data received from the AWS service. The obtained data is processed and enriched and, as a result, saved to the ITRS Log Analytics indexes.

### AWS Cost & Usage Report

The integration of ITRS Log Analytics with the AWS billing environment requires access to AWS Cost & Usage reports, which generated in accordance with the agreed schedule constitute the basic source of data for cost analysis in ITRS Log Analytics. The generated report is stored on S3 in the bucket defined for this purpose and cyclically downloaded from it by the ITRS Log Analytics collector. After the report is downloaded, it is processed and saved to a dedicated Elasticsearch index. The configuration of generating and saving a report to S3 is described in the AWS documentation:  https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-and-usage-reporting/.

### Cloud Trail

The integration of the ITRS Log Analytics with the AWS environment in order to receive events from the AWS environment requires access to the S3 bucket, on which the so-called AWS Trails. The operation of the ITRS Log Analytics collector is based on periodical checking of the "cloudtraillogs" bucket and downloading new events from it. After the events are retrieved, they are processed so that the date the event occurred matches the date the document was indexed.
The AWS Trail creation configuration is described in the AWS documentation:  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.html#creating-a-trail-in-the-console. 

### Configuration

#### Configuration of access to the AWS account

Configuration of access to AWS is in the configuration file of the AWS service (CLI), which was placed in the home directory of the Logstash user:

```
/home/logstash/.aws/config
 [default]
aws_access_key_id=A************************4
aws_secret_access_key=*******************************************u

```
The "default" section contains aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key.
Configuration file containing the list of AWS accounts that are included in the integration:

`/etc/logstash/lists/account.txt`

#### Configuration of AWS profiles

AWS profiles allow you to navigate to different AWS accounts using the defined AWS role  for example : "LogserverReadOnly". Profiles are defined in the configuration file:

`/home/logstash/.aws/config`

```
Profile configuration example:
[profile 111111111222]
role_arn = arn: aws: iam :: 111111111222: role / LogserverReadOnly
source_profile = default
region = eu-west-1
output = json
```

The above section includes
- profile name;
- role_arn - definition of the account and the role assigned to the account;
- source_profile - definition of the source profile;
- region - AWS region;
- output - the default format of the output data.

#### Configure S3 buckets scanning

The configuration of scanning buckets and S3 objects for the "s3" dashboard was placed in the following configuration files:
- /etc/logstash/lists/bucket_s3.txt - configuration of buckets that are included in the scan;

- /etc/logstash/lists/account_s3.txt - configuration of accounts that are included in the scan;

#### Configuration of AWS Cost & Usage reports

Downloading AWS Cost & Usage reports is done using the script:
"/etc/logstash/lists/bin/aws_get_billing.sh"

In which the following parameters should be set:
- BUCKET = bucket_bame - bucket containing packed rarpotes;
- PROFILE = profile_name - a profile authorized to download reports from the bucket.

#### Logstash Pipelines

Integration mechanisms are managed by the Logstash process, which is responsible for executing scripts, querying AWS, receiving data, reading data from files, processing the received data and enriching it and, as a result, submitting it to the ITRS Log Analytics index. These processes were set up under the following Logstash pipelines:

```
- pipeline.id: aws
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/aws/conf.d/*.conf"
  pipeline.workers: 1
 
- pipeline.id: awstrails
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/awstrails/conf.d/*.conf"
  pipeline.workers: 1
 
- pipeline.id: awss3
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/awss3/conf.d/*.conf"
  pipeline.workers: 1
 
- pipeline.id: awsbilling
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/awsbilling/conf.d/*.conf"
  pipeline.workers: 1 
```

#### Configuration of AWS permissions and access

To enable the correct implementation of the integration assumptions in the configuration of the IAM area, an Logserver-ReadOnly account was created with programming access with the following policies assigned:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "backup:Describe*",
                "backup:Get*",
                "backup:List*",
                "cloudwatch:Describe*",
                "cloudwatch:Get*",
                "cloudwatch:List*",
                "ec2:Describe*",
                "iam:GenerateCredentialReport",
                "iam:GetCredentialReport",
                "logs:Describe*",
                "logs:Get*",
                "rds:Describe*",
                "rds:List*",
                "tag:Get*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowSpecificS3ForLogServer",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::veoliaplcloudtraillogs",
                "arn:aws:s3:::veoliaplcloudtraillogs/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Data indexing

The data in the indexes has been divided into the following types:
   - awscli-* - storing volumetric data about AWS infrastructure;
   - awsbilling-* - storing billing data from billing reports;
   - awscli-trail-* - storing AWS environment events / logs from CloudTrail;
   - awsusers-000001 - storing data about users and administrators of the AWS service.

## Integration with Azure / o365

### Introduction
The goal of the integration is to create a single repository with aggregated information from multiple Azure / o365 accounts or subscriptions and presented in a readable way with the ability to search, analyze and generate reports.

### Scope of Integration

The scope of integration include:

1. User activity:

   - Event category,
   - Login status,
   - Client application,
   - Location,
   - Type of activity,
   - Login problems and their reasons.

2. Infrastructure Metrics:

   - Azure Monitor Metrics (or Metrics) is a platform service that provides a single source for monitoring Azure resources.
   - Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for web developers on multiple platforms and can be used for live web application monitoring - it automatically detects performance anomalies.


### System components
#### Logstash
Logstash is an event collector and executor of queries which, upon receipt, are initially processed and sent to the event buffer.

#### Kafka
Component that enables buffering of events before they are saved on ITRS Log Analytics Data servers. Kafka also has the task of storing data when the ITRS Log Analytics Data nodes are unavailable.

#### ITRS Log Analytics Data
The ITRS Log Analytics cluster is responsible for storing and sharing data.

#### ITRS Log Analytics GUI
ITRS Log Analytics GUI is a graphical tool for searching, analyzing and visualizing data. It has an alert module that can monitor the collected metrics and take action in the event of a breach of the permitted thresholds.

### Data sources
ITRS Log Analytics can access metrics from the Azure services via API. Service access can be configured with the same credentials if the account was configured with Azure AD.
Configuration procedures:

 - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal

 - https://dev.loganalytics.io/documentation/Authorization/AAD-Setup

 - https://dev.applicationinsights.io/quickstart/


#### Azure Monitor datasource configuration
To enable an Azure Monitor data source, the following information from the Azure portal is required:
   -  Tenant Id (Azure Active Directory -> Properties -> Directory ID)
   -  Client Id (Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations -> Choose your app -> Application ID)
   -  Client Secret (Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations -> Choose your app -> Keys)
   -  Default Subscription Id (Subscriptions -> Choose subscription -> Overview -> Subscription ID)


#### Azure Insights datasource configuration
To enable an Azure Insights data source, the following information is required from the Azure portal: 
   -  Application ID
   -  API Key

### Azure Command-Line Interface
To verify the configuration and connect ITRS Log Analytics to the Azure cloud, it is recommended to use the Azure command line interface:

   -  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest

This tool deliver a set of commands for creating and managing Azure resources. Azure CLI is available in Azure services and is designed to allow you to work quickly with Azure with an emphasis on automation.
Example command:
   -  Login to the Azure platform using azure-cli:

```basg
az login --service-principal -u $ (client_id) -p $ (client_secret) --tenant $ (tenant_id)
```


#### Permission
The following permissions are required to access the metrics:
   -  Logon,
   -  Geting a resource list with an ID (az resource list),
   -  Geting a list of metrics for a given resource (az monitor metrics list-definitions),
   -  Listing of metric values for a given resource and metric (az monitor metrics list).

### Service selection
The service is selected by launching the appropriate pipeline in Logstash collectors:
   -  Azure Meters
   -  Azure Application Insights
The collector's queries will then be properly adapted to the chosen service.

#### Azure Monitor metrics
Sample metrics:
   -  Microsoft.Compute / virtualMachines - Percentage CPU
   -  Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces - Bytes sent
   -  Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts - Used Capacity

The Logstash collector gets the metrics through the following commands:
   -  downloading a list of resources for a given account:
/usr/bin/az resource list
   -  downloading a list of resource-specific metrics:
/usr/bin/az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource $ (resource_id)
   -  for a given resource, downloading the metric value in the 1-minute interval
/usr/bin/az monitor metrics list --resource "$ (resource_id)" --metric "$ (metric_name)"

Azure Monitor metric list:

   -  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported 

The downloaded data is decoded by the filter logstash:

```conf
filter {
        ruby {
            code => "
              e = event.to_hash
              data = e['value'][0]['timeseries'][0]['data']
                for d in Array(data) do
                  new_event = LogStash::Event.new()
                  new_event.set('@timestamp', e['@timestamp'])
                  new_event.set('data', d)
                  new_event.set('namespace', e['namespace'])
                  new_event.set('resourceregion', e['resourceregion'])
                  new_event.set('resourceGroup', e['value'][0]['resourceGroup'])
                  new_event.set('valueUnit', e['value'][0]['unit'])
                  new_event.set('valueType', e['value'][0]['type'])
                  new_event.set('id', e['value'][0]['id'])
                  new_event.set('errorCode', e['value'][0]['errorCode'])
                  new_event.set('displayDescription', e['value'][0]['displayDescription'])
                  new_event.set('localizedValue', e['value'][0]['name']['localizedValue'])
                  new_event.set('valueName', e['value'][0]['name']['@value'])
                  new_event_block.call(new_event)
                end
              event.cancel()
           "
        }
        if "_rubyexception" in [tags] {
                drop {}
        }
        date {
                match => [ "[data][timeStamp]", "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZZ" ]
        }
        mutate {
                convert => {
                        "[data][count]" => "integer"
                        "[data][minimum]" => "integer"
                        "[data][total]" => "integer"
                        "[data][maximum]" => "integer"
                        "[data][average]" => "integer"
                }
        }
}
```

After processing, the obtained documents are saved to the Kafka topic using Logstash output:

```conf
output {
        kafka {
                bootstrap_servers => "localhost:9092"
                client_id => "gk-eslapp01v"
                topic_id => "azurelogs"
                codec => json
        }
}
```

## Google Cloud Platform

The ITRS Log Analytics accepts data from the Google Cloud Platform using the Pub/Sub service. Pub/Sub is used for streaming analytics and data integration pipelines to ingest and distribute data. It's equally effective as a messaging-oriented middleware for service integration or as a queue to parallelize tasks. [https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview)

To fetch events from the GCP service add the following condition to the Logstash configuration file:

```conf
  input {
          google_pubsub {
                  # Your GCP project id (name)
                  project_id => "augmented-form-349311"

                  # The topic name below is currently hard-coded in the plugin. You
                  # must first create this topic by hand and ensure you are exporting
                  # logging to this pubsub topic.
                  topic => "topic_1"

                  # The subscription name is customizeable. The plugin will attempt to
                  # create the subscription (but use the hard-coded topic name above).
                  subscription => "sub_1"

                  # If you are running logstash within GCE, it will use
                  # Application Default Credentials and use GCE's metadata
                  # service to fetch tokens.  However, if you are running logstash
                  # outside of GCE, you will need to specify the service account's
                  # JSON key file below.
                  json_key_file => "/etc/logstash/conf.d/tests/09_GCP/pkey.json"

                  # Should the plugin attempt to create the subscription on startup?
                  # This is not recommended for security reasons but may be useful in
                  # some cases.
                  #create_subscription => true
          }
  }
  filter {}
  output {
          elasticsearch {
                  hosts => ["127.0.0.1:9200"]
                  index => "gcp-%{+YYYY.MM}"
                  user => "logstash"
                  password => "logstash"
                  ilm_enabled => false
          }
  }
```

Authentication to the Pub/Sub service must be done with a private key: [https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating)


## F5 
The ITRS Log Analytics accepts data from the F5 system using the SYSLOG protocol. The F5 configuration procedure is as follows:  [https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13080](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13080)

To identify events from a specific source, add the following condition to the Logstash configuration file:

   ```conf
   filter {
        if "syslog" in [tags] {
                if [host] == "$IP" {
                    mutate {
                        add_tag => ["F5"]
                    }
                }
        }
   }
   ```

Where $IP is IP address of source system and each document coming from the address will be tagged with 'F5'
Using the assigned tag, the documents is send to the appropriate index:

   ```conf
   output {
     if "F5" in [tags] {
       elasticsearch {
         hosts => "https://localhost:9200"
         ssl => true
         ssl_certificate_verification => false
         index => "F5-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"

## Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop

This ITRS Log Analytics has the ability to acquire data from Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop. 

An example command to enable Citrix Broker Service log to a file is as follows:

  ```PowerShell
  BrokerService.exe –Logfile "C:\XDLogs\Citrix Broker Service.log"
  ```

Or there is the possibility of extracting results, data from a report generated using the console:

[https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenapp-and-xendesktop/7-15-ltsr/monitor/configuration-logging.html#generate-reports](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenapp-and-xendesktop/7-15-ltsr/monitor/configuration-logging.html#generate-reports)

The ITRS Log Analytics accepts data from Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop server using the Filebeat agent.

To identify and collect events from Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop servers, you need to set the correct path to the logs in the Filebeat configuration file.

Configure output section in `C:\Program Files (x86)\filebeat\filebeat.yml` file:

```yml
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  paths:
    - "C:\XDLogs\Citrix Broker Service.log"
```

```yml
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["127.0.0.1:5044"]
```

Test the configuration:

```bash
filebeat test config
```

and:

```bash
filebeat test output
```
The ITRS Log Analytics save collected data in `filebeat-*` index pattern and its available to review in the Discover module.

If additional agent data information is required, e.g.: IP address, add the following section in the agent configuration file:

```yml
processors:
  - add_host_metadata: 
      netinfo.enabled: true
```

## Sumologic Cloud SOAR

The ITRS Log Analytics has the ability to forward detected alerts to *Sumologic Cloud SOAR*. To do this, select the "syslog" method in the alert definition and set the following parameters:

  - Host
  - Port
  - Protocol
  - Logging Level
  - Facility

ITRS Log Analytics has the ability to create security dashboards from data found in SOAR, such as statistics. It has the ability to create and configure master views from extracted SOAR data. 

An example of an API request retrieving data:
```bash
  curl -X GET "https://10.4.3.202/incmansuite_ng/api/v2/kpi?output_set=Weekly%20summary&type=json" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9. eyJpYXQiOjE2NTc3MTg2ODAsImp0aSI6IjdmMzg1ZDdhLTc1YjYtNGZmMC05YTdmLTVkMmNjYTjZjTQ0YiIsImlzcyI6IkluY01hbiA1LjMuMC4wIiwibmJmIjoxNjU3NzE4NjgwLCJleHAiOm51bGwsImRhdGEiOnsidXNlcklkIjoxfX0. pCJlM9hxj8VdavGuNfIuq1y5Dwd9kJT_UMyoRca_gUZjUXQ85nwEQZz_QEquE1rXTgVW9TO__gDNjY30r8yjoA" -k

## JBoss

The ITRS Log Analytics accepts data from the JBoss platform using the Filebeat agent. Example configuration file for Filebeat:
```
filebeat:
  prospectors:
    -
      paths:
        - /var/log/messages
        - /var/log/secure
      input_type: log
      document_type: syslog
    -
      paths:
        - /opt/jboss/server/default/log/server.log
      input_type: log
      document_type: jboss_server_log
      multiline:
        pattern: "^[[:digit:]]{4}-[[:digit:]]{2}-[[:digit:]]{2}"
        negate: true
        match: after
        max_lines: 5
  registry_file: /var/lib/filebeat/registry
output:
  logstash:
    hosts: ["10.1.1.10:5044"]
    bulk_max_size: 1024
    tls:
      certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/tls/certs/logstash-forwarder.crt"]
shipper:
logging:
  to_syslog: false
  to_files: true
  files:
    path: /var/log/mybeat
    name: mybeat
    rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB
    keepfiles: 2
  level: info
```

To identify events from a specific source, add the following condition to the Logstash configuration file:

```
filter {
 if [type] == "syslog" {
   grok {
     match => { "message" => "%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:timestamp} %{SYSLOGHOST:hostname} %{DATA:program}(?:\[%{POSINT:pid}\])?: %{GREEDYDATA:msgdetail}" }
     add_field => [ "received_at", "%{@timestamp}" ]
     add_field => [ "received_from", "%{host}" ]
   }
   syslog_pri { }
   date {
     match => [ "timestamp", "MMM  d HH:mm:ss", "MMM dd HH:mm:ss" ]
   }
 }
 else if [type] == "jboss_server_log" {
   grok {
         match => { "message" => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp} %{LOGLEVEL:loglevel} +\[%{DATA:logger}\] %{GREEDYDATA:msgdetail}" }
         add_field => [ "received_at", "%{@timestamp}" ]
         add_field => [ "received_from", "%{host}" ]
   }
 }
}
```

## Energy Security Feeds

Energy Security Feeds boosts Your security detection rules. Get connected to fresh lists of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) that contain crucial data about malware activities, attacks, financial fraud or any suspicious behaviour detected using our public traps. 
Energy Security Feeds is a set of rich dictionary files ready to be integrated in SIEM Plan. Indicators like ip adresses, certhash, domain, email, filehash, filename, regkey, url are daily updated from our lab which is integrated with MISP ecosystem. The default feeds are described in a simple JSON format. 

### Configuration

#### Bad IP list update
To update bad reputation lists and to create .blacklists index, you have to run following scripts:

```
/etc/logstash/lists/bin/misp_threat_lists.sh
```

#### Scheduling bad IP lists update

This can be done in cron (host with Logstash installed):

```
0 6 * * * logstash /etc/logstash/lists/bin/misp_threat_lists.sh
```

or with Kibana Scheduller app (only if Logstash is running on the same host).

 - Prepare script path:

```
/bin/ln -sfn /etc/logstash/lists/bin /opt/ai/bin/lists
chown logstash:kibana /etc/logstash/lists/
chmod g+w /etc/logstash/lists/
```

 - Log in to ITRS Log Analytics GUI and go to Scheduler app. Set it up with below options and push “Submit” button:

Name:           MispThreatList
Cron pattern:   0 1 * * *
Command:        lists/misp_threat_lists.sh
Category:       logstash
After a couple of minutes check for blacklists index:

`curl -sS -u user:password -XGET '127.0.0.1:9200/_cat/indices/.blacklists?s=index&v'`

```
health status index       uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   .blacklists Mld2Qe2bSRuk2VyKm-KoGg   1   0      76549            0      4.7mb          4.7mb
```

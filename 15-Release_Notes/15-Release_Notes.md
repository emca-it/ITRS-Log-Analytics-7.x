### API Changes

- Elasticsearch: Updated API endpoints.
  - Following endpoints deprecated and update with:
    - `/_auth/account` -> `/_logserver/accounts`
    - `/_license/reload` -> `/_logserver/license/reload`
    - `/_role-mapping/reload` -> `/_logserver/auth/reload`
    - `/user/updatePassword` -> `/_logserver/user/password`
  - Following endpoint was removed and replaced with:
    - `/_license` -> `/_logserver/license`

### **Breaking changes**

- During the update, the "kibana" role will be removed and replaced by "gui-access", "gui-objects", "report". The three will automatically be assigned to all users that prior had the "kibana" role. If you had a custom role that allowed users to log in to the GUI this WILL STOP WORKING and you will have to manually enable the access for users.
- The above is also true for LDAP users. If role mapping has been set for role kibana this will have to be manually updated to "gui-access" and if required "gui-objects" and "report" roles.
- If any changes have been made to the "kibana" role paths, those will be moved to "gui-objects". GUI objects permissions also will be moved to "gui-objects" for "gui-access" cannot be used as a default role.
- The "gui-access" is a read-only role and cannot be modified. By default, it will allow users to access all GUI apps; to constrain user access, assign user a role with limited apps permissions.
- "small_backup.sh" script changed name to "configuration-backup.sh" - this might break existing cron jobs
- SIEM plan is now a separate add-on package (requires an additional license)
- Network-Probe is now a separate add-on package (requires an additional license)
- (SIEM) Verify rpmsave files for alert and restore them if needed for following:
  - /opt/alert/config.yaml
  - /opt/alert/op5_auth_file.yml
  - /opt/alert/smtp_auth_file.yml

### Required post upgrade
